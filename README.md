# Elden Ring Data Analyzer
In June 2022 I feel like lore hunting has hit a road block. Famous lore hunters have immersed themselves completely in tangents or declare ER "uninterpretable" and a lot of people are speculating about a possible DLC instead of reading the text at hand. Hermeneutics have hit a road block as well: Since not even a basic timeline is agreed upon. What are the themes of a story you don't even know?

I think the answers are in the text and don't want to wait on the DLC, but when I tried finding the answers I wasn't able to keep all the information that is there in my head all the time and found myself wrapped up in inconsistencies of my own design. This repo should help clarify what really is in the text and at least present a logically sound timeline of the events we know about.
