[100140110] To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants. [100140120] Then I can set the Erdtree aflame. [100140130] And guide you.

[100150020] All I ask of you is to make the journey. [100150030] To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds. [100150040] I know... [100150050] I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin. [100150060] But it must be done to reach the path beyond. [100150070] And that is the path I wish to travel. [100150080] What is your mind? Section 60 [100160000] There is something I'd like to say. [100160010] My purpose was given to me by my mother. [100160020] But now, I act of my own volition. [100160030] I have set my heart upon the world that I would have. [100160040] Regardless of my mother's designs. [100160050] I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that. [100160060] Not even you.

[100172010] Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. Section 73 [100173000] Very well. [100173010] Tell me, when you are fully prepared. Section 74 [100174000] Are you ready to commit a cardinal sin? Section 80 [100180000] If you intend to claim the frenzied flame, [100180010] I ask that you cease. [100180020] It is not to be meddled with. [100180030] It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. [100180040] However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair...

Leave the frenzied flame alone. Section 82 [100182000] The frenzied flame is not to be meddled with. [100182010] It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. [100182020] So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone. Section 85 [100185000] I ask you, one more time. [100185010] Please, seek not the frenzied flame. [100185020] As one who strives to become a Lord, [100185030] deny not the lives, the new births of this world. [100185040] Those who would are not fit to be called Lord. [100185050] When the land they preside over is lifeless. Section 86 [100186000] Please, put a stop to this madness. [100186010] The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all. [100186020] When the land they preside over is lifeless. Section 90 [100190000] You...have inherited the frenzied flame. [100190010] A pity. You are no longer fit. [100190020] Our accord ends here.

[102001020] I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will. [102001030] Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer. [102001040] Let their wisdom wash over you. [102001050] \"Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order.\" [102001060] \"Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy.\" [102001070] \"Until it was shattered.\" [102001080] \"The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll.\" [102001090] \"Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces.\" [102001100] \"Foul curses and misery spread, unabating.\" [102001110] \"But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it.\" [102001120] \"So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act.\" [102001130] \"Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring.\" [102001140] \"Seek another of its kind.\" [102001150] \"To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order.\" [102001170] Let the words of the Fingers guide you. Section 02 [102002000] Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods; [102002010] the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. [102002020] Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. [102002030] And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished. [102002040] Listen, the Fingers speak. [102002050] \"The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods.\" [102002060] \"Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left.\" [102002070] \"The Fingers have willed it so.\" [102002080] ...Indeed. But remember one thing. [102002090] The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. [102002100] Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... [102002110] The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted. Section 03 [102003000] Well, well\u2026 I see\u2026 [102003010] A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession. [102003020] Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, [102003030] are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances. [102003040] They are\u2026valuable indeed. [102003050] These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. [102003060] And should you wish to wield that same power, well\u2026 [102003070] I will lend you the strength of the Fingers. [102003080] Heh\u2026 Do not recoil from my offer. [102003090] The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not? Section 04 [102004000] Ah. You have returned. What is it? Section 05 [102005000] Now, go forth. [102005010] Let the words of the Fingers guide you. Section 10 [102010000] I had my doubts, but...my, look at you. [102010010] Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together. [102010020] Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance. [102010030] \"Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased.\" [102010040] \"You have earned the right to become Elden Lord.\" [102010050] \"Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika.\" [102010060] \"To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order.\" [102010070] The Fingers expect... [102010080] As much from you as they do young Gideon. [102010090] Take this. A token of farewell. Section 11 [102011000] Now, go forth. [102011010] Become Elden Lord. Section 12 [102012000] Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision. [102012010] A god, in truth. [102012020] But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree. [102012030] A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood. [102012040] The Fingers speak... [102012050] \"Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence.\" [102012060] \"But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel.\" [102012070] \"Confer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort.\" [102012080] \"The Fingers have willed it so.\" [102012090] Now, you may go. Section 20 [102020000] Well, you managed to return. [102020010] You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you. [102020020] The Fingers remain still. [102020030] Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will. [102020040] When they are finished, the Fingers will again offer their guidance. [102020050] But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass. [102020060] No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait... [102020070] My, oh, my... Section 21 [102021000] It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance. [102021010] My, oh, my. Whatever will you do\u2026 Section 30 [102030000] Heavens forbid... [102030010] That is not the domain of mere men. [102030020] The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. And you say you seek the power of the Rune of Death, too? [102030030] The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death. [102030040] The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation\u2026 [102030050] Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable... [102030060] The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will. [102030070] ... [102030080] ... [102030090] But here we are... [102030100] The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will. [102030110] The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers. [102030120] Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever? [102030130] Go on. Finish the job. [102030140] Take the course you deem most worthy. Section 31 [102031000] You must find kindling. [102031010] Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree. [102031020] But special kindling is required to reignite the flame. [102031030] For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame. [102031040] And can lead you to the Rune of Death. Section 40 [102040000] You've done it, I see. [102040010] What use do you have for me, now? [102040020] I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Fingers speak again. [102040030] Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you. [102040040] Now, you may go. Section 41 [102041000] Heh, heh, heh. [102041010] You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now? [102041020] A harder taskmaster have I never met. Section 42 [102042000] Don't worry, my dear. [102042010] I'll see it to the end with you, if it please. Section 43 [102043000] Now, go forth. [102043010] Do what you believe is right. "

Section 11 [106011000] I will ask thee again. [106011010] Thou'rt possessed of the power, no? [106011020] To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent. Section 12 [106012000] Quite the stubborn one, aren't we? [106012010] Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty. [106012020] Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit. [106012030] I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master.

[106020030] Thou'rt a wild one, indeed. [106020040] Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen... [106020050] ... Section 30 [106030000] Let us speak of the past, a while. [106030010] I was once an Empyrean. [106030020] Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title. [106030030] Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. [106030040] But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. [106030050] I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. [106030060] I would not be controlled by that thing. [106030070] The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... [106030080] And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins. "

[106110010] Indeed, I am the witch Ranni. [106110020] I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite. [106110030] I did it all.

[106130040] Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also. [106130050] Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. [106130060] I am sure the others will be doing just the same. Section 31 [106131000] Speak with the three who await thee below. [106131010] Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth. [106131020] It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all. Section 35 [106135000] Good, then I ask we proceed with haste. [106135010] Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave? [106135020] It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron. [106135030] Go there to find the city's hidden treasure. Section 36 [106136000] Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below. [106136010] Like thee, they are in my service. [106136020] Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. [106136030] I am sure the others will be doing just the same. Section 37 [106137000] Speak with the three who await thee below. [106137010] Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth. [106137020] It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all. Section 40 [106140000] Ah, allow me to forewarn thee. [106140010] I shall soon enter my slumber. [106140020] And it will be some time before I wake. [106140030] This doll's body is not without its hindrances... [106140040] Still, I have high hopes for thee. [106140050] I look forward to the good news when I arise. Section 41 [106141000] I shall soon enter my slumber. [106141010] And it will be some time before I wake. [106141020] I have high hopes for thee. [106141030] I look forward to the good news when I arise. Section 45 [106145000] ... Section 70 [106170000] Ahh...It was thee. [106170010] Not Blaidd, it seemeth. [106170020] Even in my slumber, I sensed it. [106170030] It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron? [106170040] My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place. [106170050] Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. Section 71 [106171000] Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this. [106171010] Take it. [106171020] My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it. [106171030] Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire. [106171040] I can fathom what thy purpose might be. [106171050] Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see. [106171060] You may leave now. [106171070] It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service. Section 72 [106172000] What is it? [106172010] Thy purpose in approaching me was to obtain the cursemark, was it not? [106172020] You may leave now. [106172030] I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. Section 75 [106175000] Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this. [106175010] My thanks, for thy sterling efforts. [106175020] A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure. [106175030] I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion. [106175040] I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter. [106175050] I must thank Torrent too, for his part. [106175060] You may leave now. [106175070] It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service. Section 76 [106176000] What is it? You may go. [106176010] I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread. Section 90 [106190000] ... Section 91 [106191000] ... Section 92 [106192000] ... [106192010] Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we? [106192020] Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls? [106192030] Fine...fine. [106192040] I hadn't expected any soul to recognise me in this guise. [106192050] But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms. [106192060] Perform for me a service, as recompense. [106192070] Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands. [106192080] The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee. [106192090] I will not brook disobedience in this matter. Section 93 [106193000] Perform for me a service, as recompense. [106193010] Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands. [106193020] The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee. [106193030] I will not brook disobedience in this matter. "

[106200030] Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. [106200040] Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean. [106200050] But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. [106200060] I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. [106200070] I would not be controlled by that thing. [106200080] The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... [106200090] And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins. Section 01 [106201000] I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we have each been cursing the other since. [106201010] The Baleful Shadows...are their assassins. Section 10 [106210000] Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers. [106210010] Blaidd remained my loyal ally. [106210020] Heh. [106210030] Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean, [106210040] He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers. [106210050] Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me. [106210060] Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path... [106210070] That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before. [106210080] Ah, should I add thee to the list? [106210090] Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they. Section 11 [106211000] Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue. [106211010] I've let slip too much. [106211020] Forget what thou'st heard. Forget. Section 20 [106220000] O Shadow, thou'rt the last. [106220010] Tell the Two Fingers, [106220020] That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh. [106220030] With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal. Section 30 [106230000] Beautifully fought. [106230010] My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned. [106230020] Now I can finally stand before them. [106230030] This is farewell, my dear. [106230040] Tell Blaidd, and Iji... [106230050] I love them. Section 40 [106240000] So, it was thee, who would become my Lord. [106240010] Perhaps I needn't have warned thee. [106240020] I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice. [106240030] I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order. [106240040] I bid thee travel the path of the Lord. [106240050] And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more. Section 50 [106250000] ... [106250010] I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised. [106250020] I thought I might expound a little further... [106250030] Upon the order I envision. [106250040] Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. [106250050] I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. [106250060] As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove. [106250070] And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch... [106250080] All become impossibilities. [106250090] Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order. [106250100] Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord? Section 51 [106251000] Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. [106251010] And I would abandon this soil, with mine Order. [106251020] Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord? Section 60 [106260000] Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening. [106260010] The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me. [106260020] I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity. [106260030] Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand, [106260040] Didst thou think to have thy way with me? [106260050] Be gone. Hapless scum. [106260060] I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath. Section 61 [106261000] I have spoken. Away from my sight. Section 62 [106262000] This is the third time, fiend. [106262010] Enough of thy unbearable breath. "

[213052010] Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith? [213052020] Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it. Section 53 [213053000] I refuse to believe it. [213053010] I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true. Section 60 [213060000] I spoke with the girl. [213060010] She has a gift for spirit tuning. [213060020] So I told her everything I know. [213060030] I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. [213060040] It was all I could do to honour her. [213060050] I'm sorry I doubted you.

[213070030] An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter. [213070040] But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me. [213070050] I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.

Section 81 [213081000] Oh, it's you. [213081010] Don't pay me any mind. It's not important. [213081020] Just lay out your arms. Section 90 [213090000] Are you having second thoughts? [213090010] Might I have a word, then? [213090020] Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them. [213090030] The demigods. And their god.

To Radahn's festivities... [216051010] I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid. [216051020] The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang. Section 52 [216052000] Right. I see. [216052010] Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right. [216052020] If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right? Section 53 [216053000] Hmm... [216053010] So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn... [216053020] And there's a festival of war being held at Redmane Castle in Caelid, [216053030] where you can fight the man himself, once the strongest of the demigods. [216053040] It's all coming together. Seems like Iji was on to something. [216053050] I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then... Section 60 [216060000] Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time. [216060020] The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain... [216060030] Let's give them a show to remember, eh. [216060040] Just don't you go dying on me. For Ranni's sake, too. Section 61 [216061000] Once more into the fray together, eh. [216061010] Heh. This might even be fun. Section 62 [216062000] Into the fray together, eh. [216062010] Heh. Let's see what you're made of. Section 63 [216063000] Ah, thought I might find you here. [216063010] I must admit I was a little worried. We missed our meeting. [216063020] But it looks like you're still in one piece, eh. [216063030] You must have heard by now, right? [216063040] That Starscourge Radahn holds Ranni's fate in stasis. [216063050] But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion. [216063060] So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all. [216063070] The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang. Section 64 [216064000] Hm. Long time. [216064010] Seems we're fated to keep crossing paths. [216064020] Now, we find ourselves at a festival of combat, pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods. [216064030] The way ahead is pleasingly simple. A path forged by sword and fang. Section 65 [216065000] Mm... As a fellow combatant, allow me to introduce myself. [216065010] Blaidd, warrior. [216065020] Now, we find ourselves pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods. [216065030] The way ahead is pleasingly simple; a path forged by sword and fang. Section 66 [216066000] Hm. Nothing to do but wait. Until the festival begins. Section 80 [216080000] Ah, good. I was waiting for you. [216080010] What a sick way to fight, eh. [216080020] The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. [216080030] And hah! Did you see that, afterwards? [216080040] A falling star, right before our eyes! [216080050] I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. [216080060] He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. [216080070] And, the path has now been cleared. [216080080] To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided. [216080090] Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth. [216080100] We'll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni. Section 81 [216081000] Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth. [216081010] And we'll go into battle again, side by side. [216081020] My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate, sword and fang. [216081030] The curtain's rising...on the final act. Section 82 [216082000] Hmph, what a sick way to fight, eh mate. [216082010] The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you. [216082020] And then a falling star, right before our eyes! [216082030] I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale. [216082040] He was a living legend, if ever I saw one. Section 83 [216083000] Well, it's time I left. [216083010] The wheel of fate has been set into motion. [216083020] If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again. [216083030] You are a fine warrior. Section 84 [216084000] If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again. [216084010] You are a fine warrior. Section 90 [216090000] howl "

[220030030] What's going on here? A door, from thin air! [220030040] Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. [220030050] I suppose my calculations were right all along. You should head this way as well, friend. [220030060] Heh heh... Section 31 [220031000] ...! [220031010] The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from? [220031020] This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. [220031030] What's going on here? A door, from thin air! [220031040] Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds. [220031050] Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped! [220031060] Heh heh... Section 32 [220032000] ...! [220032010] Where did you spring from? [220032020] This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it. [220032030] What's going on here? A door, from thin air! [220032040] Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward I shall go. [220032050] I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. [220032060] I was heading to Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. [220032070] Where a festival is being held. Until I was stumped by that dead end! [220032080] Heh heh... Section 33 [220033000] It's time I set off. [220033010] To the festival at Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds. [220033020] Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter! Section 40 [220040000] Ah, you came, how delightful! [220040010] Indeed, I thought I might find you here. [220040020] By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held? [220040030] Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself! [220040040] To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh... [220040050] In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. [220040060] But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking! [220040070] Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. [220040080] I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. Section 41 [220041000] Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior. [220041010] I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. The pleasure is mine. [220041020] Do you know for whom this festival is being held? [220041030] Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself! [220041040] To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh... [220041050] In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute. [220041060] But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking! [220041070] Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. [220041080] I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. Section 42 [220042000] Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend. [220042010] I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal. Section 50 [220050000] A-ah, hello there. [220050010] It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend. [220050020] I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock. [220050030] One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out... [220050040] After that, I hid like a coward. [220050050] And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you. Section 51 [220051000] ...But don't you think I've given up just yet. [220051010] As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here. [220051020] If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time. [220051030] And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine. [220051040] Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars! [220051050] Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! [220051060] Just you wait, when next we meet! [220051070] Heh heh... Section 52 [220052000] Alright lads, I'm going to take you on a little journey. [220052010] You'll all be inside me, and be part of me. [220052020] From now on, we're all in it together. [220052030] So let's all of us dream big. Section 53 [220053000] The bodies found here are exceedingly fine. [220053010] Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars! [220053020] Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger! [220053030] Just you wait, when next we meet! [220053040] Heh heh... Section 60 [220060000] Hello-o? Can you hear me? [220060010] Help me! I'm stuck! [220060020] Hello? Hellooo! Anyone? Section 61 [220061000] Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! [220061010] As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole. [220061020] Would you mind helping me out, again? [220061030] My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job! [220061031] My thanks in advance, I know you're the woman for the job! [220061040] You know what to do, hm? [220061050] Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big. [220061060] Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival. [220061070] I'm stuck back together good and proper! [220061080] Just give it your all! Section 62 [220062000] Ah! [220062010] Ouuch! Section 63 [220063000] P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this! [220063010] Would you stop hitting me for a minute! Section 64 [220064000] I see. More's the pity. [220064010] No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing. [220064020] Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait. Section 65 [220065000] What's that look, good sir? [220065001] What's that look, good lady? [220065010] Are you willing to help me out after all? Section 66 [220066000] Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big! Section 67 [220067000] I can feel my lower half is stuck on something. [220067010] I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time. [220067020] Hmm... [220067030] Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly... [220067040] What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch? Section 68 [220068000] Hmm... [220068010] Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly... [220068020] What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch? Section 69 [220069000] Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face! [220069010] As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in a hole. [220069020] Would you mind helping me out? Section 70 [220070000] Ngh! [220070010] Nngh! [220070020] Oh, yes! [220070030] That's the ticket! Section 71 [220071000] Nnngh! Section 72 [220072000] My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits. [220072010] As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this. Section 73 [220073000] Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad! [220073010] There were countless oil jars back where I'm from, actually. [220073020] And now I know what it's like to be one of them! [220073030] Heh heh... Section 74 [220074000] Yes, indeed, I too have a home. [220074010] Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return. [220074020] So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer... [220074030] Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole. [220074040] I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness. [220074050] To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past! [220074060] I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north. [220074070] I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel. [220074080] I will forge myself anew in its flames! Section 75 [220075000] I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north. [220075010] I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel. [220075020] I will forge myself anew in its flames! Section 80 [220080000] Ngh! [220080010] Rnnngh! [220080020] O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames! [220080030] Rrrrngh! Section 81 [220081000] Nnngh! [220081010] Ah, good sir, what business might you have in such a place as this? [220081011] Ah, good lady, what business might you have in such a place as this? [220081020] I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that fleshly form of yours. [220081030] Your timing though, is impeccable as ever! [220081040] I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here. [220081050] Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee. [220081060] But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here. [220081070] I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again. [220081080] Perhaps I'll head eastward. [220081090] There's an old saying I've caught wind of. [220081100] \"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars.\" Section 83 [220083000] Perhaps I'll head eastward. [220083010] There's an old saying I've caught wind of. [220083020] \"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars.\" Section 90 [220090000] Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself. [220090010] The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves. [220090020] But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh. [220090030] I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god... [220090040] Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many. [220090050] Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you. [220090060] Would you kindly undertake my ordeal? [220090070] Come and tell me when you're ready. [220090080] I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you. Section 91 [220091000] You are ready then, I take it? [220091010] Then let us begin! [220091020] I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander! [220091030] Lend me strength, O warriors within! [220091040] Let us become one champion, together! Section 92 [220092000] Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself. [220092010] The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves. [220092020] But that aside, I can't believe you felled that giant. It was practically a god... [220092030] I doubt there's another soul out there who could've done the same. [220092040] Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many. [220092050] Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you. [220092060] Would you kindly undertake my ordeal? [220092070] Come and tell me when you're ready. [220092080] I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you. "

Oh, yes, I remember. [223003010] Some clod turned me into a tree. [223003020] You were just breaking the spell, weren't you. [223003030] Thank you. The name's Boc. [223003040] I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever. [223003050] Then I ended up as a tree. [223003060] Lucky you came along, really. Section 04 [223004000] Oh, what a shame. [223004010] When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned, [223004020] and so this is all I have to express my thanks. [223004030] I hope you can forgive me. [223004040] Or, if you can afford to wait for a while, [223004050] I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value. [223004060] Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon. Section 05 [223005000] Right, but I'll need a moment. [223005010] I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself. [223005020] My knees start knockin'...just thinking about that god-awful cave on the shore... Section 10 [223010000] Oh, what are you doing here? [223010010] You must leave this place at once.

[223011020] sob [223011030] What made you go and do a thing like that... [223011040] My mum was a seamstress... [223011050] ...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by. [223011060] I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum. [223011070] Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I. Section 12 [223012000] Thank you. [223012010] You're very kind. [223012020] I always wanted to be a seamster, l-like my mum. [223012030] Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I. Section 13 [223013000] Oh.. [223013010] It...hurts... [223013020] Ooh... Section 20 [223020000] Good to see you! Master. [223020010] Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human. [223020020] You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle. [223020030] Please, master. [223020040] Allow me to serve you, as your seamster. [223020050] I can't make nothing from scratch, but\u2026 [223020060] I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments. Section 21 [223021000] Boc the seamster, at your service, Master. [223021010] Ready to make adjustments to your garments. Section 22 [223022000] Oh, going so soon? [223022010] Please, do be safe on your journeys. Section 23 [223023000] Master, I was wondering... [223023010] Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself? [223023020] I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please. [223023030] I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well... [223023040] I am your personal seamster, after all! [223023050] I am your personal seamster, after all! Section 30 [223030000] Master, my apologies. [223030010] Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods, [223030020] and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them. [223030030] My mum told me once. [223030040] That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy. [223030050] Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too! Section 31 [223031000] Is that a gift for my undeserving self? [223031010] Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it... [223031020] Oh! [223031030] Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life! [223031040] With a spectacular royal crest, to boot... [223031050] Are you certain that this is for me? [223031060] Oh, I can hardly believe it. [223031070] Have faith in me, Master! [223031080] I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift! [223031090] I'll be the golden seamster, Boc! [223031100] Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods! Section 32 [223032000] Do you think that Mum would be pleased if she knew? [223032010] That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now. [223032020] Oh, it's still not enough. [223032030] I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her. Section 40 [223040000] Master, may I ask you something? [223040010] Would you mind if I called you lord? [223040020] I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord. [223040030] Well, I know that you will be the one, [223040040] and you'd make just the manner of kind-hearted lord that I'd wish for. [223040050] So, please, if you would. [223040060] Allow me to call you lord. Section 41 [223041000] You don't say! Thank you, thank you! [223041010] M'lord, m'lord, m'lord! [223041020] Please, become Elden Lord. [223041030] And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side. Section 42 [223042000] No, and why would you... [223042010] Forgive me, for overstepping my bounds. I didn't mean it. Section 43 [223043000] Boc the seamster, at your service, m'lord. [223043010] Ready to make adjustments to your garments. Section 44 [223044000] Going already, m'lord? [223044010] Please, do be safe on your journeys. Section 45 [223045000] Master, did you see it? [223045010] Th-the Erdtree? [223045020] I, oh, I don't really have the words for this... [223045030] But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast. [223045040] The Erdtree is waiting for you, master. [223045050] I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones. Section 46 [223046000] M'lord, did you see it? [223046010] Th-the Erdtree? [223046020] I, oh, I don't really have the words for this... [223046030] But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast. [223046040] The Erdtree is waiting for you, m'lord. [223046050] I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones. [223046060] O please, take the throne of Elden Lord. Section 50 [223050000] M'lord... Have you ever wished you might be born again? [223050010] Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria [223050020] has the power to help people be reborn. [223050030] Oh? Me? Reborn? [223050040] Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly... [223050050] well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid. Section 51 [223051000] M'lord, what's this? [223051010] Oh! Oh! [223051020] It can't be\u2026 For my rebirth? [223051030] But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me? [223051040] Oh... [223051050] M'lord, how did you know? [223051060] It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance. Section 52 [223052000] M'lord, it shouldn't take me long. [223052010] I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria. [223052020] I'll be reborn, fresh and new. Section 53 [223053000] M'lord. [223053010] In all honesty, what do you think of me? [223053020] Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness? [223053030] Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me? [223053040] Oh, I'm such a fool. [223053050] I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions. Section 54 [223054000] Master... Have you ever wished you might be born again? Section 55 [223055000] Master, what's this? [223055050] Master, how did you know? Section 56 [223056000] Master, it shouldn't take me long. Section 57 [223057000] Master. [223057020] Am I fit to serve you, master, in all my ugliness? Section 60 [223060000] Did I just hear my mum speaking? [223060010] Thank you very much. [223060020] Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful. [223060030] And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice. [223060040] Please, if I may dream, just once... [223060050] Do you feel the same way my mum did, m'lord? [223060060] Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks? Section 61 [223061000] sob [223061010] M'lord, my dear lord... [223061020] I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service. [223061030] May the throne of Elden Lord be yours. Section 62 [223062000] No, why on earth would you... [223062010] It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did. [223062020] But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance. [223062030] One day, I'll look every bit the servant. Section 65 [223065000] Did I just hear my mum speaking? [223065010] Thank you very much. [223065020] Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.

        "content": "Section 01 [224001000] Well, look at you. We don't receive many visitors. [224001010] I presume you are a Tarnished. What brings you here? Section 10 [224010000] Oh, pardon me. It's hardly my place to ask, is it. [224010010] I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals\u2026 [224010020] An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer. [224010030] So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot. [224010040] Perhaps you'd like a display? These bones are old, but still able. Section 11 [224011000] Well, it's kind of you to speak to me again. [224011010] Then I presume these old bones served their purpose, more or less? Section 12 [224012000] Brave Tarnished. Here to put my old bones to work again? Section 13 [224013000] Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please. [224013010] This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point. [224013020] When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract. [224013030] After leveling it, they carried on to the manor. [224013040] The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught... [224013050] By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day. [224013060] That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor. [224013070] Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo. Section 14 [224014000] Oh, watch out, there. [224014010] When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else. [224014020] If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm. [224014030] I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished. [224014040] You don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work. Section 15 [224015000] Something else for you? Section 16 [224016000] I've explained the peril. [224016010] Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor. [224016020] Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap. Section 17 [224017000] Blaidd actually did that, did he? [224017010] Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he. [224017020] Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you. [224017030] At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd, [224017040] I've a few more things that might suit you. [224017050] I've something else that might suit you. Section 20 [224020000] Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. [224020040] Again, I am Iji. [224020050] The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. [224020060] I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd. [224020070] I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success. Section 23 [224023020] The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor. [224023030] I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd. [224023040] I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success. Section 24 [224024000] Oh, then you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything. [224024010] The pleasure is mine. I am Iji. Section 30 [224030000] I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella? [224030010] Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City. [224030020] After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron. [224030030] By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above. [224030040] Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city. [224030050] Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped. [224030060] To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here... Section 31 [224031000] Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother. [224031010] Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood. [224031020] They were always happy to have me tag along, as well. [224031030] When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean, [224031040] Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals, [224031050] but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together. [224031060] Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you? [224031070] The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you. Section 32 [224032000] Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while. [224032010] Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family. [224032020] An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric. [224032030] No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival. [224032040] Oh, no, wait... [224032050] How did I not see it before! [224032060] I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight! [224032070] Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars. [224032080] As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line. [224032090] But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars. [224032100] Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory. [224032110] And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. [224032120] As would Lady Ranni's destiny. [224032130] Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron. Section 33 [224033000] My apologies for the misleading words of warning. [224033010] I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate. [224033020] I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not. [224033030] Do forgive me, my fellow. [224033040] Let us give all that we can of ourselves. [224033050] Together, for Lady Ranni. Section 34 [224034000] Let us give all that we can of ourselves. [224034010] Together, for Lady Ranni. Section 35 [224035000] Let us give all that we can of ourselves. [224035010] Together, for Lady Ranni. Section 36 [224036000] Well, my fellow. How may I serve you? [224036010] As war counsellor, or as blacksmith? Section 37 [224037000] Greetings, my fellow. How can I help? Section 38 [224038000] Something else for you? Section 39 [224039000] Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds. [224039010] Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement. [224039020] Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron. Section 40 [224040000] Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything. [224040010] You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars. [224040020] The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all. [224040030] There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character. [224040040] Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened. [224040050] Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave. [224040060] And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. Section 41 [224041000] Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you. [224041010] Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron. [224041020] Blaidd has been given an important task. [224041030] Apparently, a matter of great urgency. Section 42 [224042000] You need not await Blaidd. [224042010] Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave. [224042020] And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. [224042030] So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean. Section 50 [224050000] Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated... [224050010] Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled. [224050020] Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role. [224050030] Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made. [224050040] With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality... [224050050] Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed... Section 51 [224051000] Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while. [224051010] Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family. [224051020] An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric. [224051030] It's funny how things happen. [224051040] Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate. [224051050] I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor... Section 60 [224060000] I presume you've spoken with Blaidd? [224060010] Very well. There is something you should know. [224060020] The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery. [224060030] But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers, [224060040] the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse. [224060050] But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight. [224060060] It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake. Section 70 [224070000] Unthinkable, how could Blaidd... [224070010] How did he break free from his cell? [224070020] No, more importantly... [224070030] Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her. [224070040] I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor... [224070050] I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd. [224070060] When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology. "

[300004050] If you have, why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us? [300004060] Rise with us, against the Erdtree. Section 05 [300005000] Your decision is most welcome. [300005010] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. [300005020] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. [300005030] I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you. Section 06 [300006000] Well. That is unfortunate. [300006010] Now, time for you to leave, I should think. [300006020] Let this intersection of our paths be the last. Section 07 [300007000] Did you read the letter left for you? [300007010] That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact. [300007020] You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck. [300007030] If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it. [300007040] But you must leave this house at once. [300007050] This is a war against the Erdtree. [300007060] We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands. Section 08 [300008000] What's this? [300008010] Have you reconsidered the prospect? [300008020] Of rising with us, against the Erdtree? Section 09 [300009000] Very well. [300009010] Your decision is most welcome. [300009020] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. [300009030] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. Section 10 [300010000] You've completed your task. [300010010] I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor. [300010020] This is your reward, as promised. [300010030] Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion. [300010040] The way is tainted, but for this very reason, [300010050] it is the true path to valour. Section 12 [300012000] I see you've performed another task for us. [300012010] Here is your usual reward. Please, take it. [300012020] Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you. [300012030] Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard. [300012040] The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace. [300012050] But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task. [300012060] The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs. [300012070] Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering. [300012080] Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us. [300012090] If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so, [300012100] then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy. [300012110] We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done. [300012120] If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you. [300012130] The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle. [300012140] It cannot come a day too soon! Section 13 [300013000] The letter describes the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact. [300013010] You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck. Section 14 [300014000] If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you. [300014010] It cannot come a day too soon! Section 21 [300021000] She said that, to you? [300021010] I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough. [300021020] Well. Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you. [300021030] That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage. [300021040] Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself. [300021050] What matters one's lineage in such a crisis? Section 22 [300022000] No, I haven't seen Zorayas anywhere. [300022010] And she has no scouting duties now. [300022020] Has she gone off in search of answers? [300022030] Why won't she just listen... Section 23 [300023000] May I ask your aid? [300023010] Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother. [300023020] If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress, [300023030] have her drink this potion. [300023040] To purge that which would cause her pain. Section 24 [300024000] Yes, I know. [300024010] My wish is a grave disrespect to her. [300024020] No different than the Erdtree's imposition. [300024030] But I've no choice... It must be done. Section 25 [300025000] Thank you, for allowing me this. [300025010] I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail. [300025020] Our Lord must have known this all along. [300025030] My meekness is all too clear... Section 26 [300026000] Really, she is dead, then... [300026010] My gratitude for your forthrightness. [300026020] If you would...allow me some time alone. Section 29 [300029000] Please, allow me some time alone. Section 30 [300030000] I see that you've stayed the path of champions. [300030010] This is your usual reward. Please, take it. [300030020] Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord? [300030030] Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions. Section 31 [300031000] Yes, as it should be. [300031010] Now, close your eyes for a moment. [300031020] I will transport you to the Lord's chamber. [300031030] Farewell, then. [300031040] May your visit be fruitful. Section 32 [300032000] I see... Well, I cannot make you take the leap. [300032010] But do know this. [300032020] To follow the path of valour, an audience with our Lord is essential. [300032030] In order to defy this debasement, and rise up against the Erdtree. [300032040] Like a true recusant of the Volcano Manor. Section 33 [300033000] Won't you consider having an audience with our Lord? [300033010] Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions. Section 40 [300040000] You... [300040010] It's true then. You've defeated our Lord. [300040020] No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that. [300040030] Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger. [300040040] Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part. Section 41 [300041000] I will leave the Volcano Manor before long. [300041010] I suggest you do the same. [300041020] Here is my thanks. For allowing our Lord to be revived, even stronger than before. [300041030] I will miss these encounters. [300041040] The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more. [300041050] I always was an admirer. Section 50 [300050000] Oh, you... [300050010] Allow me some time. [300050020] Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed. [300050030] Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me, [300050040] I wish to be your serpent; your family. [300050050] One day, let us devour the gods together. Section 51 [300051000] Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me, [300051010] I wish to be your serpent; your family. [300051020] One day, let us devour the gods together. Section 76 [300076000] Now, time for you to leave, I should think. [300076010] Let this intersection of our paths be the last. Section 77 [300077000] The drawing room is through the hall. [300077010] Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable. Section 78 [300078000] What's this? [300078010] Have you reconsidered the prospect? [300078020] Of rising with us, against the Erdtree? Section 79 [300079000] Very well. [300079010] Your decision is most welcome. [300079020] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family. [300079030] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable. Section 80 [300080000] Now, time for you to leave, I should think. [300080010] Let this intersection of our paths be the last. Section 81 [300081000] The drawing room is through the hall. [300081010] Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable. Section 82 [300082000] Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor. [300082010] I am pleased to have you on our side. "

[301001030] But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck. [301001040] You are maidenless. A bit player, fully divorced from the strength of runes. [301001050] Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere. Section 02 [301002000] Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament? [301002010] It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot. [301002020] Fine, then. [301002030] If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are, you'll require an education. [301002040] On the ways of the learned Tarnished. [301002050] Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished. [301002060] You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times. [301002070] That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. [301002080] It's nothing short of a miracle. That the guidance of grace can lead you, [301002090] maidenless as you are, to the perfect place to die in obscurity. Section 03 [301003000] What's the matter? [301003010] Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such? [301003020] Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace. [301003030] To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff. [301003040] And if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle, [301003050] you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold\u2026 Section 04 [301004000] Guidance will show the way, most certainly. [301004010] To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff. [301004020] The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted. [301004030] Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm. [301004040] Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply. There's no worse fate than to be maidenless. [301004050] Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle, [301004060] you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold\u2026 Section 11 [301011000] Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we? [301011010] Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm? [301011020] Of course you have. No shame in it. [301011030] Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless. [301011040] Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold... [301011050] You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity. Section 12 [301012000] Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless. [301012010] Me. Varr\u00e9. Take care to listen. [301012020] Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished. [301012030] You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times. [301012040] That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. [301012050] Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers. [301012060] It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow. [301012070] Even if it leads you to your grave. Section 13 [301013000] Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly. [301013010] To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff. [301013020] The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted. Section 14 [301014000] It's time you set off, I should think. [301014010] To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you. [301014020] If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are. Section 20 [301020000] Ohh, well done, well done indeed. [301020010] You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil. [301020020] And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold\u2026 My sincerest congratulations. [301020030] But, how did you find the Roundtable? [301020040] Oh, you don't have to say it. [301020050] Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens. [301020060] I fear you've been terribly disappointed. [301020070] I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks. [301020080] Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak. Section 21 [301021000] Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed. [301021010] To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune, and request audience... [301021020] ...with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. [301021030] They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished. [301021040] Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself. Section 22 [301022000] Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune. [301022010] Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune. [301022020] Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft... [301022030] So. Prepare for the worst. Section 23 [301023000] ... [301023010] Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well. [301023020] Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided. [301023030] But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways, [301023040] I'm always willing to hear you out. Section 24 [301024000] Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the Roundtable proper? Section 25 [301025000] What's the matter? [301025010] Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold? [301025020] Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, [301025030] for without a Great Rune, you will not be granted audience. [301025040] With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. Section 26 [301026000] Ohh, well done, well done indeed. [301026010] You bested Godrick the Grafted, and claimed a Great Rune. [301026020] You felled a demigod, and claimed a Great Rune. [301026030] My congratulations. [301026040] Now, visit the Roundtable Hold. [301026050] For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. Section 27 [301027000] Go to the Roundtable Hold. [301027010] For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber. Section 30 [301030000] Ah, there you are. [301030010] You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold. [301030020] You've had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold. [301030030] What was your impression? Section 31 [301031000] Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well. [301031010] My doubts had been piling up, you see. [301031020] ...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted. [301031030] Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. [301031040] I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. [301031050] Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. [301031060] That's the part that irks the most. Section 32 [301032000] Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise. Section 33 [301033000] A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers. [301033010] Give it a try, won't you? [301033020] And if it please you, may we meet again. [301033030] I've high hopes for you. My lambkin. Section 34 [301034000] You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be. [301034010] You may go, then. My work here is done. [301034020] May the wisdom of the Two Fingers guide you. Section 35 [301035000] Oh? Is something wrong? Section 36 [301036000] Be sure to try that finger I gave you. [301036010] There's no reason to dither. [301036020] The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world? [301036030] Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them. Section 37 [301037000] Be sure to try that finger I gave you. [301037010] I'm quite certain that you'll take to it. Section 50 [301050000] Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here. [301050010] I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift. [301050020] Mmm, I knew it from the very start. [301050030] You have a taste for noble blood. [301050040] ... [301050050] I wish to anoint you a proper inductee. [301050060] A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty. [301050070] Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love. [301050080] So, what do you say, my lambkin? Section 51 [301051000] Mm, yes, who would have it any other way? [301051010] Now, take this. [301051020] For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood. [301051030] Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers. [301051040] But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do. Section 52 [301052000] Oh my, perhaps you misheard me. [301052010] Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two. [301052020] For your ears to clear out. Section 53 [301053000] Oh, it's you. [301053010] Could you tell me once more? Your honest reply. Section 54 [301054000] Ahh, my lambkin. [301054010] You've completed your final trial. [301054020] And with this, you are a formal inductee. [301054030] A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty. [301054040] Now, give me your finger. [301054050] This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you. [301054060] Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something. [301054070] Never forget that feeling of agony. [301054080] For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us. [301054090] Ha ha ha... [301054100] You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin. Section 55 [301055000] Oh, another thing. You should have this. Section 56 [301056000] A medal granted by the new Mohgwyn dynasty. [301056010] With the power to grant audience with Luminary Mohg. [301056020] I've gone out of my way to provide one to you. [301056030] But you mustn't use it just yet. [301056040] The meeting must wait until the Mohgwyn dynasty commences. [301056050] Luminary Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity. [301056060] We must endure a little longer. Section 57 [301057000] Ahh, it is trying, but we must be patient. [301057010] One day, you will be elevated, deservedly, basking in love. [301057020] Right, my lambkin? [301057030] Ha ha ha... Section 58 [301058000] The cloth is your final trial. Soak it with the blood of a maiden. [301058010] The blood of anyone's maiden will do. You are maidenless, after all. Section 80 [301080000] What business does a maidenless wretch like you have here? [301080010] Did you come seeking violence, upon learning my esteemed position under Luminary Mohg? [301080020] I'll take pleasure in ensuring you regret this. [301080030] Before you die in obscurity. Section 81 [301081000] You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty? [301081010] I am pained, to the very depths of my being.

Section 83 [301083000] I made a grave error. Section 84 [301084000] Why must I be... [301084010] Disgraced by this lowborn... Section 85 [301085000] O...Luminary...Mohg...

[303003020] There's one by the name of Ordovis, and I must find him. [303003030] He's an old hero of the Shattering, but there's a grudge out against him. [303003040] The Lands Between are brimming with those who cannot die. It makes for a cesspool of vengeance. [303003050] ...Gives me a shiver just thinking about it...

[303005030] There's an aberration of a blacksmith past the checkpoint that leads to Stormveil. [303005040] He doesn't seem to think much of anyone or anything, but oddly, he's willing to smith weapons for Tarnished. [303005050] He has a fine arm. Have him take a crack at your goods. [303005060] ...The question for me, of course, is whether he's in need of any vengeance... Section 06 [303006000] In the Lands Between, everyone lives longer than they should. [303006010] They may go mad, but even so, they plead to the God of Vengeance. [303006020] That's why I'm here. To exact revenge for those who can't do it themselves.

[303010020] I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis of the Crucible. [303010030] It was a revenge so sweet, fit to serve the very God of Vengeance. [303010040] Heh... [303010050] Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer, as well... [303010520] I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis, the Crucible Knight. Section 11 [303011000] Ah, you... [303011010] Did you defeat Ordovis of the Crucible? [303011020] I could sense it. The God of Vengeance surely smiled upon that battle. [303011030] Heh... [303011040] Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer too... [303011510] Did you defeat Ordovis, the Crucible Knight. Section 13 [303013000] Alright, then. [303013010] I'm off to Stormveil Castle. [303013020] Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting... [303013030] Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood. [303013040] A demigod, yes, he may be... [303013050] But no one escapes a Redeemer. Section 14 [303014000] I was thinking... [303014010] Godrick must have an idea. [303014020] About the vengeance sought by General Radahn, to whom I swore my oath. [303014030] ...Yes, Godrick's corpse will know what to do... [303014510] Godrick must know. [303014920] That of all the grudges born of the Shattering, Malenia the Rotted is the object of the most profound. Section 15 [303015000] Ahh, my head is throbbing, everything is bright red...

[307017030] I have enough on my plate. Section 30 [307030000] Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion? [307030010] Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought. [307030011] Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought. [307030020] Very well. Then you shall have your gift. [307030030] Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis. [307030040] I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but... [307030050] If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady. Section 31 [307031000] You wish to begin right this moment? [307031010] Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it. Section 32 [307032000] Begging for another lesson so soon? [307032010] There remains much to be done. Make it quick. Section 33 [307033000] Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not. [307033010] Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break. Section 40 [307040000] Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you? [307040010] The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not? [307040020] Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot. [307040030] Well...there's no helping it. [307040040] Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it. [307040050] There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave. [307040060] She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy. [307040070] I asked her to look into the matter some time ago. [307040080] I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her. Section 41 [307041000] So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly? [307041010] Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it. [307041020] It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe. [307041030] I may have expected too much of her, to begin with. Section 50 [307050000] You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please? [307050010] Your oafishness knows no bounds. [307050020] Fine and well. [307050030] You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion. [307050040] I believe that makes you my accomplice. [307050050] You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm? [307050060] Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed. [307050070] But perhaps I can make a very special exception. [307050080] Now, choose. Section 51 [307051000] Ah, I knew you'd see things my way. [307051010] You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such... [307051020] You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish. [307051030] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are. [307051031] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are. [307051040] Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road. [307051050] To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire. [307051060] Now, choose. Section 52 [307052000] Well, this is a surprise. [307052010] But aren't we forgetting something? [307052020] The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught. [307052030] You are already my accomplice. [307052040] Are you ready to change your mind, now? [307052050] It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish. Section 53 [307053000] Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss. [307053010] Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own. Section 54 [307054000] (huge sigh) [307054010] You truly are beyond salvation. [307054020] Fine. Leave this place, and never darken my doorstep again. [307054030] Ah, what a terrible pity. [307054040] This is the last time I'll see you, in your present state. Section 55 [307055000] I thought I told you never to show your face again. [307055010] Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology? Section 56 [307056000] Good, good. [307056010] As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology. [307056020] And well, you finally realised, did you? [307056030] All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart. [307056040] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are. [307056041] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are. [307056050] Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road. [307056060] To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire. [307056070] Now, choose. Section 60 [307060000] How's the puppet I gave you? [307060010] A thing of exquisite craft, is it not? Section 70 [307070000] What's that? You want another puppet? [307070010] Quite the keen paramour, aren't we. [307070011] Well, aren't you a woman of many passions. [307070020] But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me. [307070030] I can hardly just give them away. [307070040] Oh dear, what's to be done? [307070050] Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards? [307070060] It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue. [307070070] If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you. [307070080] The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few. [307070090] And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them. [307070100] Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road. Section 80 [307080000] You're proving to be quite the puppeteer. [307080010] I've not had an apprentice for\u2026a very long time indeed. Section 81 [307081000] Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine? [307081010] It will produce the finest of puppets. [307081020] Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands. [307081030] A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound? Section 82 [307082000] Ahh, I knew I had you pegged. [307082001] Heh. I knew I had you pegged. [307082010] You're just like me. [307082020] Then I'd like you to procure something. [307082030] A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. [307082040] With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. [307082050] And even a demigod would be slave to its charms... [307082060] Procure it for me. [307082070] The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. [307082080] With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. [307082090] And even a demigod would be slave to its charms... Section 83 [307083000] Very good. [307083010] A wise choice, indeed. [307083020] You passed my little test with flying colours. [307083030] I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni. [307083040] Well done, I'm very proud of you. [307083050] Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady. Section 84 [307084000] Ah ha. Might you be interested after all? [307084010] In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni? Section 85 [307085000] Alright, enough of these games. [307085010] Your test is well and truly over. [307085020] Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind. [307085030] I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams. Section 90 [307090000] Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it! [307090010] The blessed day is finally upon us... [307090020] Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting. [307090030] To think, this was once a demigod's very fate... [307090040] My oh my oh my... Section 91 [307091000] Ah, are you still here? [307091010] Oh yes, I should give you your reward. [307091020] Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous. [307091030] Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin. [307091040] The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly... Section 92 [307092000] Good, I've been waiting for you. [307092010] It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet. [307092020] Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it. [307092030] The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably. [307092040] Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona\u2026she's a frail, gentle girl at heart. [307092050] Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it. [307092060] Which is why you're the only one for the job. [307092070] Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught. Section 93 [307093000] You...understand, don't you? [307093010] That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition. [307093020] And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted. [307093030] Just imagine...the pure elation... Section 94 [307094000] Come now, don't make me wait. [307094010] I can barely contain myself as it is... Section 95 [307095000] You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you. [307095010] The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly... "

[309020030] Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch. Section 21 [309021000] Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium. Section 22 [309022000] Cheers for that. Section 23 [309023000] Stingy little beggar... [309023010] Try to find it in your heart next time, eh? Section 24 [309024000] Yeah, I had those bandits make a clean break. [309024010] Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that. [309024020] I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying, [309024030] but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection. [309024040] They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army. [309024050] Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish. [309024060] ...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all. Section 25 [309025000] Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest? [309025010] Well, it's uh, nothing too special. [309025020] Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer... [309025030] But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin... [309025040] And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming... [309025050] Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take. Section 26 [309026000] Forgot something on your shopping list? [309026010] No, no trouble to me. Section 41 [309041000] By the way, friend... [309041010] You've really been there for me, through thick and thin. [309041020] And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you. [309041030] An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer. Section 42 [309042000] What's wrong? I've made up my mind. [309042010] The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed. [309042020] Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold. [309042030] But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless! Section 50 [309050000] Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. [309050010] You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. [309050020] Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm? [309050030] But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience. [309050040] At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. [309050050] And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium! Section 51 [309051000] Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. [309051010] You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. [309051020] Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests? [309051030] No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate. [309051040] At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. [309051050] And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium! Section 60 [309060000] Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave. [309060010] I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on. [309060020] No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop. [309060030] They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face. [309060040] Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh? Section 70 [309070000] Oh, well! It's been a long while. [309070010] It's me. Patches the Untethered. [309070020] I'm still in business, if you can believe it. [309070030] Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch. [309070040] Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria. Section 71 [309071000] You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell. [309071010] That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt. [309071020] In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it... [309071030] (laughs) Section 72 [309072000] Oh, really? No interest in the statuette? [309072010] I was sure it would catch your eye. [309072020] Well, I can't force it on you, but... [309072030] Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else... Section 73 [309073000] By the way, have you met that girl Rya? [309073010] I spotted her somewhere along the highroad not long ago. [309073020] She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help. [309073030] Not that it's any of my business, but... [309073040] If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear? Section 74 [309074000] Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose. Section 80 [309080000] Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine... [309080010] Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium! Section 81 [309081000] You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no? [309081010] Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination. [309081020] Have you ever seen an iron virgin? [309081030] The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels. [309081040] ...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition. [309081050] And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [309081060] Its transpositional powers fully intact. [309081070] So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose... [309081080] It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told... [309081090] Ha ha...ha ha... Section 82 [309082000] Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like. [309082010] There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [309082020] And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree. [309082030] Heh heh...ha ha... Section 90 [309090000] Well, fancy meeting you here. [309090010] Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend. [309090020] I spoke no lie, not a one. [309090030] You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake, [309090040] but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out. [309090050] I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear. [309090060] But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right? "

[309120030] All good, though. We're on the same side, now. [309120040] We'll do good work together. Section 21 [309121000] Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like. [309121010] Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you. Section 30 [309130000] Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing. [309130010] This is for you. Section 31 [309131000] You're new here at the Manor. [309131010] But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing. [309131020] Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right? [309131030] Go on, break a leg, then. [309131040] Heh heh... Section 32 [309132000] What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey? [309132010] Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon. [309132020] We're not here to make your life easier. [309132030] Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree. [309132040] Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with? Section 33 [309133040] You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with? Section 34 [309134000] You hunted down Tragoth? [309134010] Are you certain? [309134020] No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed. [309134030] I'll give Tanith the news. [309134040] Have some rest, by all means. Section 35 [309135000] Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor. [309135010] I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers. [309135020] I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade. [309135030] Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious. [309135040] I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it. [309135050] Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud. [309135060] I've never seen a woman quite like her... Section 36 [309136000] Hmph. [309136010] Sharper than you seem, aren't you... [309136020] I was just holding onto it for you, you know. [309136030] Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours. Section 50 [309150000] Now you've gone and killed Rykard? [309150010] You scheming little bastard. [309150011] You scheming little doxie. [309150020] Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical... [309150030] Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all... [309150040] But for now, this Manor is finished. [309150050] The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head. [309150060] A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy. [309150070] Heh heh...ha ha... [309150080] Well, here I am. Untethered, once again. [309150090] Good-bye, my friend. Section 51 [309151000] What is it? [309151010] Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium? Section 60 [309160000] Ah, oh, you again... [309160010] A shame you had to see me like this... [309160020] Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all. [309160030] I should have stuck to what I know best... [309160040] No matter. I know I-I can trust you. [309160050] Gullible, yes, but a good soul. [309160060] Make certain that Tanith gets this. [309160070] Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape. [309160080] C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong. Section 61 [309161000] You're able, then? [309161010] Then I can rest easy, my friend... Section 70 [309170000] Well, well, well? [309170010] Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings? [309170020] You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance! [309170030] Cough up your coin, all of it! Section 71 [309171000] Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you? [309171010] Oh, cripes, please, wait! [309171020] I surrender! I surrender, I swear! Section 72 [309172000] Do you even hear me? I said \"surrender\", loud and clear! [309172010] No one likes a bull-headed brute! [309172020] You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you? Section 73 [309173000] Cripes! Are you dense, mate? [309173010] What in the world has gotten into you! [309173020] Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming. [309173030] Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch! Section 74 [309174000] Well, glad to see we're on the same page. [309174010] I'd never cross you, not even close. [309174020] He he he... Section 75 [309175000] Ahhh... [309175010] It's been ages since I've seen you. [309175020] I didn't even realise it was you. [309175030] Took you for a demi-human, or some such. [309175040] You know how it is, just an innocent mistake. [309175050] Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual? Section 76 [309176000] Hell's bells... [309176010] This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be... [309176020] Especially if we keep running into the likes of you... [309176030] ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads... Section 77 [309177000] ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads... Section 90 [309190000] Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time. [309190010] For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium. [309190020] Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch! Section 91 [309191000] Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium. Section 92 [309192000] Cheers for that. Section 93 [309193000] What, do I have to beg? [309193010] Give us a coin or two next time around, will you? Section 94 [309194000] Forgot something on your shopping list? [309194010] No trouble to me. "

I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south. [310001030] The servants there...have rebelled. [310001040] I-I can't be sure what it is; my eyesight's been weak since birth you see... [310001050] But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over. [310001060] My good father secreted me out the castle, [310001070] but decided himself to stay. He says it's his duty, as commander. Section 02 [310002000] I understand. [310002010] I fear some of the castle's servants are still prowling nearby. [310002020] Do take care on the road. I pray your journey comes to fruition. [310002030] And if you happen to change your mind... [310002040] Please come to see me again. Section 03 [310003000] Hello? Is somebody there? [310003010] Ah, you're the one from before, aren't you? [310003020] Please, I implore you. [310003030] Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle? [310003040] My sole wish is that he escape, even if his honour should be the price. [310003050] Please...I just need him to be safe... Section 04 [310004000] Thank you, dearly. [310004010] Then please, take this. [310004020] ... [310004030] Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please. Section 05 [310005000] Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle. [310005010] He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around. Section 06 [310006000] I...I fear for father's life. [310006010] The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us. [310006020] They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with. They haven't spared a soul. [310006030] I fear it's no different at Castle Morne... [310006040] Please, I implore you. [310006050] Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle? [310006060] My sole wish is that he escape, even if his honour should be the price. [310006070] Please...I just want him to be safe... Section 10 [310010000] Hello? Is someone there? [310010010] My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light. [310010020] If I might be so bold as to ask... [310010030] Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me? [310010040] My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see. I can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next. [310010050] But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light in the back of my eyes. [310010070] It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden. Section 11 [310011000] Hello? Is someone there? [310011010] Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me? [310011020] I'm on a pilgrimage in search of the distant light. [310011030] And when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel the light in the back of my eyes. Section 12 [310012000] Oh, many thanks to you. [310012010] Now I can feel the distant light once more. [310012020] You are most kind, indeed. [310012030] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. Section 13 [310013000] You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you... [310013010] They rest their trembling hands upon me. [310013020] Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes. [310013030] Their frail fingers, emaciated... Yet still, they give me the grapes. [310013040] But you...seem somehow...firmer. Section 14 [310014000] Oh, many thanks to you. [310014010] Now I can feel the distant light once more. [310014020] That aside, I wonder what Shabriri grapes really are? [310014030] Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... [310014040] What a sight they must be to behold. Section 15 [310015000] N-No... That's not possible... [310015010] Not all of those people... Their own... [310015020] So those noises I heard were... [310015030] ... [310015040] retching [310015050] Sorry... I'm alright now. [310015060] Don't mind me... Section 16 [310016000] ... Section 17 [310017000] Ah, is that you over there? [310017010] I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you. [310017020] The reason why it was eyes I had to eat. [310017030] The distant light is far and frail. [310017040] So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye. [310017050] But with everyone's eyes together, it appears. [310017060] Finally, it all makes sense. [310017070] I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden. Section 19 [310019000] You are most kind, indeed. [310019010] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. Section 20 [310020000] You are most kind, indeed. [310020010] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. Section 21 [310021000] I wonder, what are Shabriri grapes? [310021010] Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... [310021020] What a sight they must be to behold. Section 22 [310022000] I apologise. You only did as I asked. [310022010] I'll be fine. Think no more of it. Section 23 [310023000] I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you. [310023010] I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden. Section 30 [310030000] Oh hello, is that you over there? [310030010] Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes? [310030020] They're special grapes which only grow on those who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers... [310030030] I would truly love to try one... [310030040] The distant light seems far closer than before, [310030050] But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore... [310030060] Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me? [310030070] Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad. Section 31 [310031000] Oh, Oh! [310031010] A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape! [310031020] Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns... [310031030] Thank you. I've composed myself again. [310031040] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you. Section 32 [310032000] Oh, that's right. [310032010] ...Might I ask a boon of you? [310032020] Look after this for me, if you please. [310032030] It's been so long, I don't know how I came upon it, but I've been looking for its owner. [310032040] Now I'm to be a Maiden though, it'll never find its way home. [310032050] Which is why I'd like you to have it. [310032060] It must be very, very precious indeed. Section 33 [310033000] They're special grapes which only grow on those who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers... [310033010] Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me? [310033020] Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad. Section 34 [310034000] Thank you from the bottom of my heart. [310034010] I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden. Section 40 [310040000] Ah, so you're here as well, are you? [310040010] ...I realised as we've talked. [310040020] I'll be a Maiden, and you... Surely, a Lord. [310040030] Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions. [310040040] It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you. [310040050] May the flame of chaos find purchase within you. Section 41 [310041000] Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions. [310041010] It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you. Section 50 [310050000] Ahh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you. [310050010] Could you please rest your hand upon me? [310050020] Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden... Section 51 [310051000] Oh, it burns... [310051010] My eyes, my eyes, they're melting... [310051020] Aaargh! [310051030] ... Section 52 [310052000] Could you please rest your hand upon me? [310052010] Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden... Section 53 [310053000] ... [310053010] Thank...thank you... [310053020] I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers. [310053030] As your maiden, allow me to divine them. [310053040] All that there is came from the One Great. [310053050] Then came fractures, and births, and souls. [310053060] But the Greater Will made a mistake. [310053070] Torment, despair, affliction. Every sin, every curse. [310053080] Every one, born of the mistake. [310053090] And so, what was borrowed must be returned. [310053100] Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame. [310053110] Until all is One again. Section 54 [310054000] Those who gave me grapes howled without words. [310054010] Saying they wished they were never born. [310054020] Become their lord. [310054030] Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse. [310054040] And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos. [310054050] No more fractures. No more birth... [310054060] ... "

[312001030] If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book. [312001040] I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. [312001050] Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time? [312001060] Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. [312001070] But when the stars align, we celebrate. [312001080] A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn, [312001090] the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune. Section 02 [312002000] Well, good. [312002010] As you should. The festival affords glory to warriors. [312002020] Then all you need is a little patience. [312002030] When the stars align, the festival will be declared. Section 03 [312003000] Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum? [312003010] No matter. One day you will see. [312003020] That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. Section 04 [312004000] Have patience, mm. [312004010] When the stars align, the festival will be declared. Section 05 [312005000] Go on, now. [312005010] This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet. Section 06 [312006000] One day you will see, chum. [312006010] That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. Section 07 [312007000] Go on, now. [312007010] This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet. Section 20 [312020000] Well, I haven't heard that name in an age. [312020010] Then you must serve Princess Ranni? [312020020] The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this: [312020030] The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate back into motion. [312020040] By the by\u2026 Is that old fool still hammering out weapons? [312020050] His enormous frame, cramped in that little place... [312020060] Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him. [312020070] And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone. [312020080] But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot... Section 30 [312030000] Champions, welcome! [312030010] The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh! [312030020] General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you! [312030030] Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune! [312030040] A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival! Section 31 [312031000] Are you good and prepared, young chum? [312031010] The festival begins! Section 34 [312034000] But now, we must make merry. [312034010] O gathering of champions, the revels begin! [312034020] The celebration of war! The Radahn Festival! Section 35 [312035000] You will find the field of battle past the church ahead, upon the shore under the fort. [312035010] General Radahn is there, even now. [312035020] Divested of his wits, devouring corpses\u2026 [312035030] And howling at the sky... Section 36 [312036000] I see... [312036010] When you are ready, come to me again. Section 40 [312040000] At last, the war festival has ended. [312040010] Brave champion, you have our gratitude. [312040020] The celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased. [312040030] Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honourable death. Section 41 [312041000] Finally, my work is done. [312041010] I am no longer bound to this fortress. [312041020] I have a task in mind. [312041030] Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand. [312041040] May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion. Section 42 [312042000] It's time I went on my way. [312042010] May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion. Section 50 [312050000] Ah, well met. [312050010] I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places. [312050020] You didn't...know Sellen, did you? [312050030] Well, whatever the case, she's dead now. [312050040] Just put it behind you. [312050050] She was known as the Graven Witch. [312050060] Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand. [312050070] The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy. Section 51 [312051000] Oh, a Tarnished, are you? [312051010] You didn't...know Sellen, did you? Section 52 [312052000] It is strange, though... [312052010] The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled. [312052020] I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere. [312052030] I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body. [312052040] A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me. Section 53 [312053000] I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere. [312053010] I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body. [312053020] A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me. Section 60 [312060000] My thanks, for the aid given. [312060010] I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion. [312060020] But I didn't know he was talking about you. [312060030] You've helped me fulfil an old promise. [312060040] This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. Section 61 [312061000] My thanks, for the aid given. [312061010] Always a pleasure to witness the festival champ put on a display. [312061020] You've helped me fulfil an old promise. [312061030] This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. Section 62 [312062000] My thanks, Tarnished, for the aid given. [312062010] You've helped me fulfil an old promise. [312062020] This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. Section 63 [312063000] Well, I must be leaving now. [312063010] Brave warrior, if the fates deign it... [312063020] No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney. Section 64 [312064000] Well, I must be leaving now. [312064010] If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished. "

[313003010] It's rather chilly here, isn't it? [313003020] My mistress sent me off on an errand... [313003030] But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind. [313003040] Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps? [313003050] That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it. [313003060] I would be sure to provide ample reward. [313003070] Only... He, too, is Tarnished. [313003080] If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another... Section 04 [313004000] Ohh, thank you dearly. [313004010] What a blessing that we've met like this. [313004020] The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way... [313004030] Please, I must have the necklace back. Section 05 [313005000] Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do. [313005010] I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own. [313005020] But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again. Section 06 [313006000] Have you had a change of heart? Section 07 [313007000] The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way... [313007010] Please, I must have the necklace back. Section 10 [313010000] Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace. [313010010] Thank you kindly. I am in your debt. [313010020] Did I forget to announce myself? [313010030] I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor. [313010040] I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house. [313010050] You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, [313010060] but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. [313010070] Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks. [313010080] Please, take this. [313010090] Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree. [313010100] Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree... [313010110] But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven, [313010120] the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions. Section 11 [313011000] Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you... [313011010] This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road. [313011020] But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage. [313011030] Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff. [313011040] At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. [313011050] It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau. [313011060] I have faith in you. A champion, through and through. [313011070] I do hope that we can meet again. Section 12 [313012000] I've been waiting for you. [313012010] I knew you had the stuff of champions. [313012020] I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. [313012030] Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress. [313012040] I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith. Section 13 [313013000] I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith. Section 14 [313014000] Very well. [313014010] Speak to me again once you are ready. [313014020] You will find me here. Section 15 [313015000] Are you ready, then? [313015010] I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. [313015020] Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress. [313015030] I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith. Section 16 [313016000] Give me your hand. [313016010] I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith. Section 20 [313020000] Hello... Hello... [313020010] Right over here... [313020020] But I hardly hold him in high regard. [313020030] He seems to bear animosity toward the Volcano Manor. [313020040] Perhaps it is to be expected, only... [313020050] his intent, while vicious, is also tenuous, as if his heart is not in it. [313020060] Doesn't really seem like champion material, to me... Section 21 [313021000] Brave Tarnished, what is your business here? [313021010] I'm afraid this is not a guest room. [313021020] What's that peculiar look upon your face? [313021030] gasp>br /> [313021040] Goodness, am I still a serpent? [313021050] Oh, how dreadful... [313021060] How dreadful indeed... [313021070] Forgive my distress. [313021080] I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance. [313021090] Brave Tarnished. [313021100] This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas. [313021110] Please forgive the deception. [313021120] Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing. [313021130] Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems. Section 22 [313022000] Lady Tanith is my mother. [313022010] I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king. [313022020] That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. [313022030] I am proud of what I am. [313022040] But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me. [313022050] And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits. [313022060] But you are not like the rest. Section 23 [313023000] My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, [313023010] were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I. [313023020] Now I share the secrets with you, as well. [313023030] Please keep them safe from anyone else. Section 24 [313024000] Seek the old ruins in the cliff. [313024010] At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. [313024020] It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau. [313024030] I have faith in you. A champion, through and through. [313024040] I do hope that we can meet again. Section 30 [313030000] Hello again. Brave Tarnished. [313030010] As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor. [313030020] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Section 31 [313031000] Have you ever... [313031010] heard any strange sounds here at the manor? [313031020] Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales... [313031030] Oh fie, what am I saying? [313031040] It just isn't possible. I must be tired. Section 32 [313032000] Um, oh, it's you. [313032010] Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. [313032020] Hmm, well... [313032030] I know I can trust you... [313032040] I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. [313032050] It entered the room across the hall, and never came out. [313032060] If I'm not mistaken, [313032070] it took the form of a serpent, just like me... [313032080] Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret, [313032090] that Lady Tanith has kept from me? [313032100] I realise that I shouldn't impose but, [313032110] if you discover anything, would you please share? [313032120] It entered the room next to this one, and never came out. Section 33 [313033000] The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night... [313033010] It entered the room across the hall, and never came out. [313033020] Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets. [313033030] If you discover anything, would you please share? [313033040] It entered the room next to this one, and never came out. Section 34 [313034000] Really... [313034010] Oh, so there was a secret after all... [313034020] Oh my... [313034030] Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me... [313034040] Was I not... [313034050] born by the grace of a king? Section 35 [313035000] Hello again. Brave Tarnished. [313035010] It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand, [313035020] but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. [313035030] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Section 36 [313036000] Hello again. Brave Tarnished. [313036010] Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia. [313036020] I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. [313036030] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Section 37 [313037000] A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished. [313037010] I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor. [313037020] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Section 38 [313038000] Brave Tarnished. [313038010] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour. Section 39 [313039000] Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. [313039010] Like breathing, or slithering scales. [313039020] Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired. Section 40 [313040000] Hmm, what is this? [313040010] I remember this scent, distinctly. [313040020] ... [313040030] Funny, isn't it. [313040040] I am certain of it. I was born inside this. [313040050] It's a part of my birth mother. [313040060] You have my gratitude. [313040070] Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid. [313040080] I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith. [313040090] One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart. Section 41 [313041000] Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me... [313041010] Was I not... [313041020] born by the grace of a king? Section 42 [313042000] I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith. [313042010] One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart. Section 50 [313050000] Oh, it's you... [313050010] I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you. [313050020] I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual. [313050030] Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents. [313050040] Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me. [313050050] You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, [313050060] but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. [313050070] I know that you have done so much for me. [313050080] But I wish to ask one last kindness. [313050090] Kill me, please. [313050100] I thought that I feared nothing. But this... [313050110] Free me from this accursed frame. Section 51 [313051000] Agh... [313051010] Thank you... My champion... [313051020] Mother... Section 52 [313052000] I'm to drink this, then? [313052010] Yes, of course. You always were very kind. [313052020] ... [313052030] Ahh... How delightfully sweet... [313052040] And yet... Section 60 [313060000] I know that you have done so much for me. [313060010] But I wish to ask one last kindness. [313060020] Kill me, please. [313060030] I thought that I feared nothing. But this... [313060040] Free me from this accursed frame. Section 61 [313061000] You're not willing to kill me, are you. [313061010] Hah... [313061020] You've always been so kind. And uncompromising. Section 62 [313062000] I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts. [313062010] How kind, and uncompromising, you always were. Section 70 [313070000] ... Section 71 [313071000] Oh, it's you. [313071010] Heaven knows what happened here, [313071020] but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone. [313071030] It feels rather quiet without them. [313071040] But with you here, things will be just fine. Section 72 [313072000] I await Lady Tanith. [313072010] I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king. [313072020] I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern. [313072030] Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour. [313072040] I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes. "

        "content": "Section 01 [314001000] Ah, hello. You must be new here. [314001010] I'm... [314001020] Well, just call me Diallos. [314001030] The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands. [314001040] By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels? [314001050] She's my servant, but fickle as the wind. [314001060] Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone. [314001070] If you find her, please be sure to tell me. Section 02 [314002000] Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya. [314002010] She's a servant to my house. [314002020] She's been my companion since childhood. [314002030] I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this. [314002040] Honestly, she's such a little tomboy. Section 10 [314010000] Lanya... Lanya... [314010010] It's me, Diallos. Answer me, would you? Section 11 [314011000] Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you. [314011010] The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends. The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished. [314011020] They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand. [314011030] \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\" [314011040] I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. Section 12 [314012000] Ah, you again, is it? [314012010] The recusants sent a lackey. [314012020] Can you believe they invited me to join them? Now! After what they did... [314012030] I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool? [314012040] You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer. [314012050] Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout. [314012060] It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills. [314012070] That's where they hide. The manor on the peak. [314012080] Just you wait, wretched recusants. [314012090] You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya. [314012100] \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all. Section 13 [314013000] Who on earth are you? [314013010] Hmph, never mind. But tell me if you know, would you. [314013020] The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends. The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished. [314013030] They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand. [314013040] \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\" [314013050] I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. Section 14 [314014000] They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand. [314014010] \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\" [314014020] I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message. Section 15 [314015000] It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills. [314015010] That's where they hide. The manor on the peak. [314015020] Just you wait, wretched recusants. [314015030] \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all. Section 20 [314020000] Ah. Oh... I-it's you, is it? [314020010] Well. Nice to see you again. [314020020] So you've been invited as well, I see. [314020030] Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth. You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes? Section 21 [314021000] I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya... [314021010] Well, you see, I... [314021020] After much internal debate, I've come to realise... [314021030] Revenge is not the answer. [314021040] According to Lady Tanith... [314021050] I've got the stuff of champions. [314021060] And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path. [314021070] It hit me like a bolt from the blue... [314021080] That my former thoughts were simple naivet\u00e9. [314021090] Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya. [314021100] That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed. [314021110] But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't make me a champion, will it. [314021120] Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both. [314021130] But such is true of any road trod by champions. Section 22 [314022000] I always resented these hands. [314022010] Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow. [314022020] But that won't be the case for long. [314022030] They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions. [314022040] \"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood\" after all. Section 30 [314030000] Ah, it's you, is it. [314030010] I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself? [314030020] I haven't achieved anything at all thus far. [314030030] Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again. [314030040] I'm still yet to achieve anything. [314030050] Perhaps I am a fool after all... [314030060] No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house. [314030070] What an easy mark I must have been... [314030080] How did it take me so long to realise, honestly... [314030090] There's just no end to my foolishness, is there... Section 31 [314031000] It's just as my noble brother says. [314031010] I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become a champion. Section 32 [314032000] Perhaps I am a fool after all... [314032010] No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house. [314032020] What an easy mark I must have been... Section 40 [314040000] Well. Aren't you full of beans. [314040010] No wonder you're covered in muck. Section 41 [314041000] Oh? My friend, it's been far too long. [314041010] I have to say you caught me at a rather low point. [314041020] But...as you see, I've put all that behind me. [314041030] Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now. Making my own choices. [314041040] Even a fool like me can look after some simple jars. [314041050] Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow. Section 42 [314042000] A fool I may be, but I can look after some simple jars. [314042010] Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow. Section 51 [314051000] ...Ah, you... [314051010] Are the jars...they alright? [314051020] Did I defend them? Section 52 [314052000] Then all is well... [314052010] This fool proved his worth, in the end... Section 53 [314053000] Ha...ha ha... [314053010] I see... I see... [314053020] I've been a fool...to the last... "

Section 02 [316002000] Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? [316002010] Well, your aptitude does appear...passable. [316002020] But one must choose one's masters wisely. [316002030] I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, [316002040] as a reviled, apostate witch. [316002050] Do you still wish to learn from me? Section 03 [316003000] Well, you are a piece of work. [316003010] Very well. You are now my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in glintstone sorcery. [316003020] But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never. [316003030] Anticipate grievances, young apprentice. Section 04 [316004000] Really. [316004010] It's not every day I meet a Tarnished just milling about. Section 05 [316005000] What is it now? Why are you here again? Section 06 [316006000] ... [316006010] You are quite the enigma, aren't you... Section 07 [316007000] I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal... [316007010] Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck. Section 08 [316008000] Yes, I think that would be wise. [316008010] We must choose our masters wisely. Section 09 [316009000] Well? Have you made up your mind? Section 10 [316010000] Young apprentice. First things first. [316010010] You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk. [316010020] So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. [316010030] Now, shall we start learning? Section 11 [316011000] There you are, my apprentice. [316011010] Shall we commence the lesson? Section 12 [316012000] You wish to continue the lesson? [316012010] Very well, I have time aplenty. Section 20 [316020000] Our art draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone. [316020010] But what is the nature of such power? [316020020] Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos. [316020030] Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality, [316020040] while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars. [316020050] It should not be forgotten, [316020060] that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein. [316020070] A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days... Section 21 [316021000] Your appetite for learning is impressive. [316021010] You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily. [316021020] You must have a fabulous teacher. Section 30 [316030000] Hmm? What's on your mind? Section 31 [316031000] Well, well... [316031010] Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again... [316031020] But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. [316031030] The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni. [316031040] But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles. [316031050] Now, he is the force that repulses the stars. [316031060] If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement. [316031070] And so, too, would Ranni's destiny. Section 40 [316040000] My apprentice, what happened to your nail? [316040010] Perhaps you have a different view, but... [316040020] That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn. [316040030] May I remove it for you? Section 41 [316041000] A wise choice. Let me neutralize it. [316041010] But first... [316041020] Listen up, wretched curse-peddler. [316041030] This is a vile craft in which you engage. [316041040] Let it be known. [316041050] This is the beloved apprentice of Sellen, Graven Witch. [316041060] I set a curse upon you and your meddling hand. [316041070] Your death will not be a pleasant one. [316041080] May you shudder between breaths in your sleep... Section 42 [316042000] If you prefer not, that is your prerogative. [316042010] But let it be known. [316042020] That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn. [316042030] If what I have told you one day rings true, [316042040] by all means, come to me again. Section 50 [316050000] What's this sorcery, my apprentice? [316050010] Ah, then you have seen Master Azur. [316050020] Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. [316050030] A stern judge of men, but he must see something in you. [316050040] You make us both proud. [316050050] We can speak more later, my apprentice. Section 60 [316060000] If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [316060010] It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. [316060020] The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. [316060030] I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. [316060040] No matter what we give in return. [316060050] My apprentice. I presume nothing. [316060060] Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. [316060070] But hear me out, my apprentice. [316060080] I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. [316060090] Perhaps this is a journey we could take together? Section 61 [316061000] Splendid. I thank you. [316061010] This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. [316061020] You must have a fabulous teacher. Section 62 [316062000] Forgive me, it was an outlandish idea to begin with. [316062010] And I fear quite presumptuous of me, as well. [316062020] Don't give it another thought, my apprentice. Section 63 [316063000] Really? My apprentice. [316063010] You must have given this quite some thought. [316063020] Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. [316063030] It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. Section 64 [316064000] There you are, my apprentice. [316064010] Shall we commence the lesson? Section 65 [316065000] You wish to resume the lesson? [316065010] Indeed, that would be the wiser option. Section 70 [316070000] I need your help, my apprentice. [316070010] Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. [316070020] And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. [316070030] My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? [316070040] With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him. Section 71 [316071000] I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. [316071010] He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now... Section 72 [316072000] After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. [316072010] A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. [316072020] Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. [316072030] It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby... Section 80 [316080000] Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat... [316080010] You have my gratitude. This is all your work. [316080020] I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. [316080030] This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it. [316080040] This brings us a full step closer. [316080050] The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the Academy. [316080060] If only I could undo these wretched shackles... Section 81 [316081000] This brings us a full step closer. [316081010] The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. [316081020] If only I could undo these wretched shackles... Section 90 [316090000] My apprentice. Give me a moment later. [316090010] I have a favour to ask. [316090020] The form you see before you is merely a projection. [316090030] My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. [316090040] My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, [316090050] imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. [316090060] Can you make the journey to my body? [316090070] I have something that I can only trust with you. Section 92 [316092000] My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, [316092010] imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. [316092020] Can you make the journey to my body? [316092030] I have something that I can only trust with you. "

[316110020] And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. [316110030] Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. [316110040] Finally, I can return to the academy. [316110050] To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. [316110060] My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.

Section 12 [316112000] My apprentice, shall we commence the lesson? [316112010] As thanks for procuring this new form, I'll be holding you to a higher standard. Section 13 [316113000] You wish to resume the lesson? [316113010] Have I not been strict enough, I wonder? Section 20 [316120000] Ahh, my apprentice. [316120010] You've saved my skin once again. [316120020] Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more. [316120030] With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.

[316120060] Oh, I know it's not possible. [316120070] You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord. [316120080] But do think of me. [316120090] Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning. [316120100] You will always be my darling pupil. [316120110] Rest assured that I... [316120120] No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch. [316120130] My apprentice. Become Elden Lord. Section 21 [316121000] Hmm, perhaps I'm jumping ahead, [316121010] but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's. Section 22 [316122000] Do you recall what once I told you? [316122010] That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein. [316122020] When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me. [316122030] Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring. [316122040] Next time, I will be your student. Section 23 [316123000] Oh, one last thing. [316123010] If you fail to claim your throne, [316123020] you can always pay me a visit. [316123030] Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here. [316123040] Section 25 [316125000] What is it? My apprentice. Section 26 [316126000] Ahh, I am glad to see you. My apprentice. [316126010] Would you like a lesson? I'm always glad to further your education. Section 27 [316127000] It warms my heart. That you still think of me. [316127010] Yet I still yearn, for you to find Master Lusat. [316127020] His body is needed. At the academy, to hone the primeval current... Section 28 [316128000] Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat... [316128010] Oh, this is wonderful news. Now, his body will be brought home. [316128020] And when the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat are together, the academy can hone the primeval current. [316128030] So that we, fallen children of the stars, will beam once again. [316128040] I am most grateful. There are no others who would have done this. [316128050] What a joy to have you as an apprentice, and kindred spirit. [316128060] This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it. Section 29 [316129000] You wish to resume the lesson? [316129010] Good. Indeed, it is better to finish what one starts, is it not? [316129030] With the body of Master Azur returned, the academy can restore the primeval current. [316129040] So that we, fallen children of the stars, might beam with brilliance once again. Section 30 [316130000] Jerren, bringer of my death. [316130010] You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles. [316130020] But I am afraid your work is done. [316130030] Join the school. To reflect on your mistake. Section 40 [316140000] U...urgh [316140010] M-my...apprentice... [316140020] I-I'm... Section 41 [316141000] My...apprentice... Section 50 [316150000] Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. [316150010] Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. [316150020] I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. [316150030] Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice. "

[318011010] There are other Tarnished, like me, who hunt the Bloody Fingers. [318011020] If a Bloody Finger threatens you, use this ring.

Section 20 [318020000] Well, we meet again. [318020010] Beware. A great dragon roosts at Agheel Lake. [318020020] And it's as fearsome as it is majestic. [318020030] So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive... [318020040] stay clear of the lake. Section 21 [318021000] Hmm, I gave you fair warning. [318021010] To stay clear of Agheel Lake, a known dragon roost. [318021020] Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late. Section 22 [318022000] Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.

That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time. [318030010] Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times. [318030040] Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know. [318030050] That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion. [318030060] If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength, [318030070] then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast. Section 31 [318031000] You must not forget, though. [318031010] Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity. [318031020] Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens. [318031030] Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment. [318031040] The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly. [318031050] It's no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous. Section 32 [318032000] Beautiful work, felling that dragon. [318032010] And as such, there's something you might like to know. Section 33 [318033000] ... [318033010] Wretched worms, leave me be...

Section 40 [318040000] Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there. [318040010] That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him. [318040020] Here's a token of thanks. Please, take it. Section 41 [318041000] I may not have much time. [318041010] I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger... Section 42 [318042000] Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time. [318042010] She is the deadliest of all Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already. [318042020] But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight. [318042030] If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee. [318042040] There is no shame in self-preservation. Section 43 [318043000] Be on your way. [318043010] Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits. Section 70 [318070000] Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you. [318070010] But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see. [318070020] I've sliced the finger off. [318070030] Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer. [318070040] Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire... Section 80 [318080000] Finally, we meet. [318080010] The Tarnished, who would be Lord. [318080020] Oh my, why the long face? [318080030] I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel. [318080040] Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead. [318080050] As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri. [318080060] I hope you can make your peace with that. Section 81 [318081000] You are about to sacrifice something precious. [318081010] The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge. [318081020] Only so that you may be Lord. [318081030] What a horrible thing to ponder. [318081040] Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not. [318081050] But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon? Section 82 [318082000] Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor. [318082010] Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead. [318082020] If you are prepared to show resolve, [318082030] and attain Lordship through righteous hardship, [318082040] then heed the words of I, Shabriri. Section 83 [318083000] Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord. [318083010] Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital. [318083020] Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy. [318083030] If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling, [318083040] and the girl can be spared. [318083050] ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship. [318083060] The path of the Lord of Chaos. [318083070] Burn the Erdtree to the ground, [318083080] and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes. [318083090] Ahh, may chaos take the world! [318083100] May chaos take the world! Section 84 [318084000] Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord. [318084010] Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital. [318084020] Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy. Section 85 [318085000] Burn the Erdtree to the ground, [318085010] and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.

[319130080] I have a matter of my own to attend to. [319130090] And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place. [319130100] What say you? Section 31 [319131000] Very well. Show me your map. [319131010] ... [319131020] I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway. [319131030] It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. Section 32 [319132000] I have a matter of my own to attend to. [319132010] I've spotted the mark of the centipede. [319132020] An ill-omened symbol that should not be. [319132030] Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order. [319132040] And must be eradicated. Section 33 [319133000] What is it? Still milling about? [319133010] The map indicates where the gateway is hidden. [319133020] It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman. Section 34 [319134000] Well, all right, then. [319134010] No sense in forcing you. Section 35 [319135000] What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you? Section 40 [319140000] You've met Gurranq, I take it? [319140010] Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms. [319140020] I think you've earned this. [319140030] The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death. Section 41 [319141000] Did you need something else? Section 42 [319142000] Ah, hello there. What can I do for you? Section 43 [319143000] Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it. [319143010] I thank you, as your brother-in-arms. [319143020] So what can I do for you? Section 44 [319144000] Ah, hello again. [319144010] You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you? [319144020] Well, no rush. You do as you please. [319144030] Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh. Section 45 [319145000] Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right. [319145010] Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot... [319145020] Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve. Section 50 [319150000] I serve the Golden Order. [319150010] That I might put this crooked land to rights. [319150020] Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring. [319150030] Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order. [319150040] Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth. [319150050] And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last. Section 51 [319151000] Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier? [319151010] You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony? [319151020] He was a formidable spellblade, in times past. [319151030] Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind. [319151040] No more though. [319151050] You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling... [319151060] Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch. [319151070] Take well the lesson, friend. [319151080] That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death. [319151090] When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them. Section 52 [319152000] Well, what have we here? [319152010] How did you get your hands on that dagger? [319152020] ... [319152030] Well. That hardly matters. [319152040] I know very well whose dagger it is. [319152050] Why don't I return it to them for you? [319152060] Good work, bringing this to me. "

[320001030] Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads...taken. Taken and stuck to the spider. [320001040] Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid. [320001050] It's quite the lark, when you think about it. Section 02 [320002000] You're all on your own, are you? [320002010] And heading to Stormveil Castle? [320002020] Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider? [320002030] Well, that makes us two peas in a pod. [320002040] But I don't have your courage. [320002050] It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head. [320002060] I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared. [320002070] I'm nothing but a craven. Section 03 [320003000] Oh, I know. [320003010] Can you take this little one along with you? [320003020] Can you take these little ones along with you? [320003030] The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself\u2026 [320003040] And the spirits look rather fondly upon you. [320003050] It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.

[320005010] Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle? [320005020] Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough. [320005030] I'm finally getting the hang of this whole \"pain\" thing, you know. [320005040] Heh heh... Section 13 [320013000] What's this? [320013010] A keepsake? From my men? [320013020] Oh, goodness me\u2026 [320013030] I can't\u2026 [320013040] ... Section 14 [320014000] A pleasure to see you.

Nice to see you again. [320030010] My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner. [320030020] Isn't this place impressive, though? [320030030] The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord. [320030040] I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots. [320030050] Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth. [320030060] I'm still looking for my own purpose. Section 32 [320032000] You're telling me I possess some kind of gift? [320032010] I don't believe you. But... [320032020] If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first... [320032030] I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? [320032040] I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me. [320032050] Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished... [320032060] But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So... [320032070] I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all. Section 33 [320033000] Oh, and\u2026 [320033010] Please, allow to me to express my thanks. [320033020] For giving me that keepsake from my men. [320033030] It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn. [320033040] You have my gratitude. Please, take this. Section 34 [320034000] A pleasure to meet you. [320034010] My name is Roderika. I'm a recent arrival. [320034020] Isn't this place impressive?

[320040020] I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning. [320040030] I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish, [320040040] but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try. [320040050] And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted... [320040060] Well, I certainly must try. [320040070] Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Section 50 [320050000] Greetings. [320050010] Are you here for spirit tuning? Section 51 [320051000] I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late. [320051010] I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order. [320051020] I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to... [320051030] Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer. [320051040]  [320051050] Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner. Section 52 [320052000] I'd like to ask you a small favour. [320052010] Can you take this little one along with you? [320052020] Can you take these little ones along with you? [320052030] They can't be summoned here. [320052040] But the spirits look rather fondly upon you. [320052050] It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un. [320052060] They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns. Section 53 [320053000] I need to warn you about something. [320053010] A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable. [320053020] And I can hear, from all the way over there... [320053030] The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself... [320053040] A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony... [320053050] I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls... [320053060] Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen... [320053070] You should keep your distance. [320053080] I know you're strong, but please... Section 54 [320054000] I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable... [320054010] The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself... [320054020] You should keep your distance. [320054030] I know you're strong, but please... Section 55 [320055000] I can't hear them any more; the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse... [320055010] I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable. [320055020] I just pray nothing ill comes of this. Section 56 [320056000] Be on your guard, I beg you. [320056010] He's back. The Dung Eater. Again. [320056020] I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse. [320056030] And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself. [320056040] But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now. [320056050] I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order. Section 57 [320057000] The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again.. [320057010] But it isn't like last time. [320057020] I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement. [320057030] Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder? Section 60 [320060000] Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground. [320060010] The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left. [320060020] Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain. [320060030] Don't worry, I don't blame you. [320060040] I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before. [320060050] Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave. [320060060] His roots are so knotted in this place. [320060070] He won't last much longer if he stays here... [320060080] His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now. [320060090] It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him. Section 61 [320061000] I see. You're here for some spirit tuning? Section 70 [320070000] Oh, is that right... [320070010] So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either. [320070020] You have my thanks, regardless. [320070030] I'll try and talk him round next time. [320070040] I know he was given this great entreaty; [320070050] To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse. [320070060] A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika. [320070070] And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do... Section 80 [320080000] Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to... [320080010] To think he'd forget who you were, as well. [320080020] I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg. [320080030] I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now. [320080040] But maybe it's better that we don't. [320080050] It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay. Section 81 [320081000] I'll remain with Hewg. [320081010] He made me who I am today. [320081020] I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can. Section 82 [320082000] Please, become Elden Lord. [320082010] Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him. [320082020] So slay her, with the weapons he smithed. [320082030] Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all. Section 90 [320090000] You're...giving it to me? [320090010] I've never had alcohol before... [320090020] I'm no longer a child. It's about time I took this step. Section 91 [320091000] sleeping "

[321001020] Servant to the true Order, and celebrated repudiator of the false! [321001030] O Erdtree! Grant me succour! Section 03 [321003000] What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye? [321003010] My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me. [321003020] Oh I see. You wish to know the reward? [321003030] Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse. [321003040] The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval. Section 04 [321004000] Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice. [321004010] I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes. [321004020] That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of \"grafting\". [321004030] Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh. [321004040] First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle... [321004050] Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man. [321004060] Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse? [321004070] And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him. [321004080] I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it. Section 05 [321005000] What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye? [321005010] My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me. Section 10 [321010000] Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you? [321010010] Well, that's very kind, but, um... [321010020] No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished. [321010030] Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order. [321010040] You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave. [321010050] Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you. [321010060] I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. [321010070] A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood! Section 14 [321014000] Hm? What's this, kind sir? [321014001] Hm? What's this, fair lady? [321014010] Remarkable! The Knight Commander, dead. Already! [321014020] A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one. [321014030] Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed. [321014040] I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you. [321014050] Now, this is your reward. [321014060] Go on, it is yours, for the keeping. Section 20 [321020000] Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath! [321020010] Did you manage to recapture my fort? [321020020] Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot! [321020030] Well done my friend, well done indeed! [321020040] I knew I was right to trust you! [321020050] Now, here's your reward, as promised. [321020060] Go ahead, it's all yours. Section 21 [321021000] Right then. Time for me to head to the fort. [321021010] I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans. [321021020] What's that look? You don't believe me? [321021030] Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible. [321021040] Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order. [321021050] Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it. [321021060] Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch. Section 22 [321022000] Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask. [321022010] Would you like to enter my service? [321022020] I see bright things in your future, stout warrior. [321022030] Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order. [321022040] And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours. [321022050] What say you? A fine accord, is it not? Section 23 [321023000] Very well. Very well, indeed. [321023010] I knew I saw something in you. [321023020] I shall await you at my fort. [321023030] We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think. [321023040] I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed. Section 24 [321024000] Excuse me? [321024010] Such foolishness have I never seen! [321024020] Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice. [321024030] Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself. [321024040] Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort. Section 25 [321025000] What is it? Have you put your misgivings to rest? Section 26 [321026000] Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice. [321026010] Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself. [321026020] Oh don't fret, there's no hurry. [321026030] Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort. Section 40 [321040000] Why... [321040010] Why the queen... Now all hope is... [321040020] (dies) Section 50 [321050000] Ah, you, is it? [321050010] I suppose you must have seen it by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort? [321050020] Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler. [321050030] One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick. [321050040] But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. Section 51 [321051000] I am sorry to have lifted your hopes... [321051010] But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand. [321051020] The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology. [321051030] But now, I must begin my search post-haste. [321051040] For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. Section 52 [321052000] I must begin my search post-haste. [321052010] For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. Section 60 [321060000] Ah, nice to see you after so long. [321060010] Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good. [321060020] Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler. [321060030] Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage. [321060040] Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less. [321060050] For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards. [321060060] At which time I can fulfil my old promise. [321060070] By raising you to the glory of knighthood. [321060080] I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine. Section 61 [321061000] For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards. [321061010] At which time I can fulfil my old promise. [321061020] By raising you to the glory of knighthood. [321061030] I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine. "

[322001030] Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly? [322001040] Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness. [322001050] Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion. [322001060] And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing. [322001070] Do you think it vulgar, perhaps? [322001080] Where I come from, it is a sacred act. Section 02 [322002000] Ah, my thanks, great champion. [322002010] You are...very warm... [322002020] What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing. [322002030] Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid. [322002040] Come back to me, should you require another. [322002050] I will take you in my arms as often as you need. Section 03 [322003000] I understand. [322003010] Your disdain is only natural. [322003020] But should you change your mind... [322003030] Come pay me another visit. Section 04 [322004000] Oh, my dear... [322004010] Had a change of heart already? Section 05 [322005000] I am pleased to see you again. [322005010] Would you like me to hold you, once more? [322005020] The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear. [322005030] Would you like to be held, regardless? Section 06 [322006000] Now, come closer... [322006010] You are so...very warm... Section 07 [322007000] Then good day to you, my dear. Section 20 [322020000] I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from. [322020010] After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions, [322020020] I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life. [322020030] To do so is the purpose of my being. [322020040] But before I could bear the noble into new life, [322020050] I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace. [322020060] Pray, be kind. [322020070] Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion. [322020080] So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes. Section 21 [322021000] My dear... [322021010] Might I ask something of you? [322021020] Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them? [322021030] A certain person gave it to me, as a gift. [322021040] It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart. [322021050] So I would like for the original owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind. Section 22 [322022000] I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger I gave you, and return it to them. [322022010] It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart. Section 23 [322023000] My dear... [322023010] Have you ever heard of black knifeprints? [322023020] Dear Rogier likes to talk of them when abed. [322023030] And the ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain. [322023040] The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act, [322023050] along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy. [322023060] These grand affairs are hardly my fort\u00e9... [322023070] But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke... Section 24 [322024000] Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed. [322024010] The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain. [322024020] The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act, [322024030] along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy. Section 25 [322025000] I heard that you lent a hand to dear Rogier. [322025010] He seemed positively elated. [322025020] He must be possessed of great mental fortitude. [322025030] It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds. [322025040] You truly are a champion. [322025050] To dear Rogier, and myself, too. Section 27 [322027000] In truth I've heard tell from someone else, [322027010] about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so. [322027020] But It wouldn't be right to give this to him, stuck as he is in the Roundtable Hold. [322027030] Perhaps you could make use of it? Section 30 [322030000] Finally, it is returned to its rightful place. [322030010] The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble. [322030020] And now, I must bid you goodbye as well. [322030030] Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold. [322030040] I am Fia, Deathbed Companion. [322030050] Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted. [322030060] We, who humbly live in Death... [322030070] Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord. [322030080] What right does anyone have to object? [322030090] Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek. Section 40 [322040000] Ah...there you are. [322040010] I knew you would come. [322040020] What is it you intend? [322040030] To deny us, and our ways? [322040040] Like the dogmatic brutes of the Golden Order? Section 41 [322041000] I see. Then you must kill me. [322041010] For I am the companion of Godwyn, Prince of Death. [322041020] I wished to be a mother to Those Who Live in Death. [322041030] So it is, that any loathing, any hatred that overshadows them... [322041040] I must bear, as a matter of duty, with my own flesh. Section 42 [322042000] Go on, kill me. [322042010] You deny us, do you not? [322042020] Because we deign to live in Death, and wish our Lord to rise to glory. Section 43 [322043000] You are an odd one. [322043010] I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death. [322043020] They call me a foul and rotten witch. [322043030] Yet you still wish to be held by me? Section 44 [322044000] I will soon lay with Godwyn. [322044010] And it will surely stir within me. [322044020] the new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods, [322044030] as the rune of Those Who Live in Death. [322044040] Please, do one thing for me. [322044050] Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne. [322044060] Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death. [322044070] By becoming our Elden Lord. Section 45 [322045000] I will soon lay with Godwyn. [322045010] To conceive my child, the rune. [322045020] Brandish my rune, and take for yourself the throne. [322045030] Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death. [322045040] By becoming our Elden Lord. Section 46 [322046000] This is goodbye, my dear. [322046010] But I am satisfied. [322046020] I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will. Not the remains of one chosen for me. [322046030] And I will bear a child. [322046040] Who will inherit your warmth, too. [322046050] What greater blessing could there be, but to be born a Deathbed Companion? Section 51 [322051000] Have you ever seen a hallowbrand? [322051010] When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede. [322051020] Godwyn's hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Roundtable Hold. [322051030] But there is another hallowbrand out there somewhere. [322051040] And I must find it. [322051050] Before the time comes we receive our Lord. Section 52 [322052000] When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh. [322052010] But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede. [322052020] And I must find it. [322052030] Before the time comes we receive our Lord. [322052040] My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed. [322052050] Will you still let me hold you, even then? Section 53 [322053000] When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh. [322053010] But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede. [322053020] And I must find it. [322053030] Before the time comes we receive our Lord. Section 54 [322054000] ...! [322054010] This...is the other hallowbrand. [322054020] How did you... [322054030] Oh, my utmost thanks. [322054040] With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead. [322054050] And claim a second, illustrious life. [322054060] You are my-- our true champion. [322054070] And though I can't be of any use to you... [322054080] Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment? "

As your senior, I bid you welcome. [324001030] It is safe here. You may let down your guard. Section 02 [324002000] Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. [324002010] You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. [324002020] A house guest, yet to earn their keep. [324002030] Remember your place, newcomer.

[324011030] If those words held any meaning to you... [324011040] Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune. [324011050] Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open. [324011060] And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.

[324021050] General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds. [324021060] Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir. [324021070] Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell. [324021080] And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy. [324021090] ...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you? Section 22 [324022000] So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. [324022010] Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power. [324022020] His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest. [324022030] ...but I suspect you know that well enough already. Section 23 [324023000] General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. [324023010] He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. [324023020] And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat. [324023030] I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire. [324023040] And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid. [324023050] Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore... Section 24 [324024000] Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir. [324024010] He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour. [324024020] The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree. [324024030] It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering. [324024040] Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven. Section 25 [324025000] Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. [324025010] It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. [324025020] But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. [324025030] Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. [324025040] Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait. Section 26 [324026000] The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. [324026010] Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. [324026020] But Rennala herself is no demigod. [324026030] She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon, [324026040] Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort. [324026050] The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her. Section 27 [324027000] There are four more demigods yet to be located. [324027010] Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. [324027020] His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. [324027030] Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. [324027040] And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. [324027050] Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, [324027060] so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers. [324027070] If you should learn anything of these matters, [324027080] I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me. [324027090] We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. [324027100] As such, I hope we are compelled to work together. [324027580] I'll trade your findings for something rather special. Section 30 [324030000] Ah, you. What is it? Section 31 [324031000] Well...what is it now? Section 32 [324032000] Well. I see you've found another Great Rune. [324032010] Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed. [324032020] Make the journey. [324032030] To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree. [324032040] The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. [324032050] You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring. [324032060] For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace. Section 33 [324033000] Journey to the capital Leyndell, to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree. [324033010] The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. [324033020] You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring. Section 35 [324035000] General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. [324035010] He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. [324035020] And by my reckoning Radahn remains there, even now. [324035030] Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore... Section 36 [324036000] Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. [324036010] It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. [324036020] But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. [324036030] Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. Section 37 [324037000] The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. [324037010] Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. [324037020] And her Great Rune dwells within the egg she so dearly clutches. Section 38 [324038000] You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? [324038010] Then I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. [324038020] I am known as Gideon Ofnir. [324038030] As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, [324038040] I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. [324038050] You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant. Section 40 [324040000] I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli. [324040010] She is my daughter. [324040020] I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace. [324040030] Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes. [324040040] So I put her to work. [324040050] Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you. [324040060] Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. Section 41 [324041000] Ahh, you've already heard? [324041010] Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions. [324041020] So I had no further use for her. [324041030] Honestly, what's a man to do. [324041040] A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly. [324041050] I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants. [324041060] A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished. Section 42 [324042000] Is that potion what I think it is? [324042010] Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again. [324042020] Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must. [324042030] The Roundtable has no code to speak of. [324042040] But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer? [324042050] Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard? Section 43 [324043000] Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself. [324043010] You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away. [324043020] Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned. [324043030] Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing. [324043040] His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold. Section 44 [324044000] Well, I won't force you. [324044010] But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste. [324044020] She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential. [324044030] Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet. Section 45 [324045000] I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet. [324045010] Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you. [324045020] Sorry. For the time you had to waste. Section 46 [324046000] Well, I won't force you. [324046010] If you want to do that dolly botherer's bidding, that's up to you. [324046020] Not that I could fathom why you'd want to... Section 50 [324050000] Oh, my apologies for that nasty business. [324050010] Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems. [324050020] As his master, I'd like to express my regret. [324050030] But now, Ensha is slain and gone. [324050040] Finished, forever more. Section 51 [324051000] Ah, yes, by way of apology, [324051010] allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. [324051020] Find the Albinauric woman. [324051030] She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia, [324051040] She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure. [324051050] together with her great wolf. Section 52 [324052000] Find the Albinauric woman. [324052010] She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia, [324052020] She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure. [324052030] together with her great wolf. Section 53 [324053000] Ah, yes, by way of apology, [324053010] allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. [324053020] Find the village of the Albinaurics. [324053030] It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands. [324053040] And some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere. Section 54 [324054000] Find the village of the Albinaurics. [324054010] It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands. [324054020] Some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere. Section 60 [324060000] Ahh, I know already. You're after it too, aren't you. [324060010] To pass the impenetrable thorns, you seek the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants. [324060020] Then you need to reach the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region. [324060030] Hah, no need to pay me for that gift. [324060040] All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance. [324060050] That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. [324060060] It doesn't have to be me, my fellow. Section 61 [324061000] If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants. [324061010] You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region. [324061020] I marked your map with its location. [324061030] Go, if you would. Take no heed of \"cardinal sin\". [324061040] The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago. Section 70 [324070000] Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion. [324070010] I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone. [324070020] You've made more of yourself than Ensha has... [324070030] Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands. [324070040] I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead? [324070050] Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath. Section 71 [324071000] Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree? [324071010] I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill. [324071020] Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely. [324071030] But...with the Haligtree as it is... [324071040] I suppose Miquella must already be... Section 72 [324072000] Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there. [324072010] The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward: [324072020] A hidden treasure, known only to me. [324072030] A secret rite known only to me. [324072040] You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant. [324072530] And it is a wondrous thing indeed. Section 73 [324073000] So. The Haligtree, now but a husk... [324073010] I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree, [324073020] but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form. [324073030] Indeed, it seems those words held weight. [324073040] How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story... [324073050] Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified... Section 74 [324074000] Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh. [324074010] A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers. [324074020] Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable. [324074030] But perhaps it's worth looking into... [324074040] If what I've heard is right, then maybe... Section 75 [324075000] Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all! [324075010] That is some fine intelligence indeed! [324075020] With it, the final clue has been brought into the light. [324075030] One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together. [324075040] As promised, allow me to impart to you [324075050] the last of the hidden treasures known only to me. [324075060] the last of the secret rites known only to me. [324075070] a thing most wondrous, known only to me. Section 76 [324076000] Well, I wonder what comes next... [324076010] If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well. [324076020] But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it. [324076030] Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me... Section 77 [324077000] You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you? [324077010] Then the Roundtable is soon to follow. [324077020] Ah, no need to fret about that. [324077030] The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord. [324077040] And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen, [324077050] then the Roundtable must go, as well. Section 78 [324078000] I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time. [324078010] I must learn all that can be taken from this place, [324078020] and sear it into my memory. [324078030] How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less? Section 79 [324079000] The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete. [324079010] Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing. [324079020] Perhaps the same could be said of guidance. [324079030] Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished? [324079040] What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord? Section 80 [324080000] Ahh, I knew you'd come. [324080010] To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord. [324080020] What a sad state of affairs. [324080030] I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne. [324080040] Queen Marika has high hopes for us. [324080050] That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity. "

        "content": "Section 01 [325001000] Ah, nice to meet you. [325001010] The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed. [325001020] I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle. [325001030] When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is. [325001040] But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle? [325001050] This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting. [325001060] Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind... Section 02 [325002000] I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you? [325002010] You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace. [325002020] Well, enjoy it while you can. [325002030] I'm Tarnished, like you. [325002040] But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time. [325002050] Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between. [325002060] I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. [325002070] Would you care to learn one? [325002080] As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please. Section 03 [325003000] Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we? Section 04 [325004000] Oh hello there, good to see you safe. [325004010] Stopping by to learn a battle art or two? Section 05 [325005000] The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family. [325005010] They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle. [325005020] In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told. [325005030] Fascinating, isn't it? [325005040] That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past. [325005050] With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair, [325005060] such adaptability is more important now than ever. Section 06 [325006000] Of course. I understand. [325006010] Why place trust in a perfect stranger? [325006020] Be safe, then, stranger. [325006030] Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same. Section 07 [325007000] Oh? Something bothering you? [325007010] Or are you just trying to pass the time? [325007020] I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle. Section 20 [325020000] Ah, we meet again after all. [325020010] I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see. [325020020] So. What do you need? Section 21 [325021000] Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune. [325021010] Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we. [325021020] Well done, friend. [325021030] Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it. [325021040] As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me. [325021050] No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore. Section 22 [325022000] The misshapen corpse under Stormveil? [325022010] That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known. [325022020] It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. [325022030] Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. [325022040] And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. [325022050] That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. [325022060] And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering. [325022070] I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot. [325022080] The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights, [325022090] You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm? Section 23 [325023000] This...is a black knifeprint! [325023010] I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this! [325023020] You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes? [325023030] They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City. [325023040] A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye. [325023050] The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite. [325023060] Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time. [325023070] I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets. [325023080] Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death. [325023090] Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint... [325023100] Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see. Section 24 [325024000] Oh, still need something? Section 26 [325026000] Always good to see you safe. [325026010] So. What do you need? Section 27 [325027000] Ah, so you've met D. [325027010] D is an old friend. [325027020] We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death. [325027030] But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross. [325027040] Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends. Section 28 [325028000] Pleased to meet you. [325028010] The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade. [325028020] But now I'm in this sorry state. [325028030] I had a little mishap, and now I can't move. [325028040] As you might guess, it's far from ideal... Section 29 [325029000] Ah, I know. [325029010] I'm privy to a few magical battle arts. [325029020] Would you care to learn one? [325029030] Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know. [325029040] A little conversation goes a long way. Section 30 [325030000] Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you. [325030010] My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks. [325030020] Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. [325030030] Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla. [325030040] Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. [325030050] Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint. [325030060] Truly, you have my thanks. [325030070] But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you. [325030080] If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, [325030090] then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. [325030100] I would like you to procure it for me. [325030110] And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long. [325030120] Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace. [325030130] If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, [325030140] The answers you find will surely bolster your chances. Section 31 [325031000] I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts. [325031010] There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [325031020] It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends. [325031030] There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years [325031040] Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once. [325031050] But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born... Section 32 [325032000] If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, [325032010] then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. [325032020] Would you be willing to procure it for me? [325032030] She may have returned to the manor that is her home. [325032040] The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Section 33 [325033000] I'm afraid there's something I must tell you. [325033010] Do you know of Those Who Live in Death? [325033020] The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order. [325033030] By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged. [325033040] But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them. [325033050] You may find this peculiar, [325033060] but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives. [325033070] These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order. Section 34 [325034000] Yes, indeed. [325034010] If D knew what drives me now, [325034020] he would surely boil over with rage. [325034030] Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity. [325034040] But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass. [325034050] I can tell a good lie when I need to. Section 35 [325035000] And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now... [325035010] I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary... Section 36 [325036000] Oh? Forgot something, did you? Section 37 [325037000] Alright there. Good to see you safe. Section 40 [325040000] I see... [325040010] When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too. [325040020] You know, not everyone would trust such a tale... [325040030] But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess... [325040040] Then perhaps it's true after all. [325040050] Hmm. [325040060] Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but... [325040070] How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals? [325040080] Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course. [325040090] The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest. [325040100] And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly. [325040110] I know you've got what it takes. [325040120] Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. Section 41 [325041000] Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda? [325041010] While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly. [325041020] And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark. [325041030] I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger. [325041040] But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact. [325041050] Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. Section 45 [325045000] D was telling me. [325045010] That he discovered the mark of the centipede. [325045020] The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark. [325045030] As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature, [325045040] then we may be able to form an alliance. [325045050] If only I could speak to them in person. [325045060] And if they were like you, all the better. Section 46 [325046000] Hmm. Maybe I should tell you. [325046010] Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice... [325046020] Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber. [325046030] And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow. [325046040] So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand. [325046050] Since you're so scary and all.

[326001030] Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight? [326001040] Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm, [326001050] despite the collapse of the Golden Order? Section 02 [326002000] Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through. [326002010] Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever. [326002020] Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? [326002030] All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. [326002040] Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you. Section 03 [326003000] Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy. Section 04 [326004000] Ah, hello. Glad to see you safe. [326004010] Here to learn a battle art or two? Section 05 [326005000] There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover. [326005010] Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died. [326005020] A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance. [326005030] That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat. [326005040] It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself. Section 06 [326006000] Honest to a fault, I see. [326006010] Such thoughts won't behove you, as a Tarnished. [326006020] But there's nothing wrong with that. [326006030] Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? [326006040] All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. [326006050] Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good Tarnished, like you. Section 07 [326007000] Not floating your boat, eh? [326007010] Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day. Section 08 [326008000] There you are. Decided to bear the torch of my battle arts? Section 09 [326009000] Well, until we meet again. Section 10 [326010000] You... [326010010] What in heaven's name are you doing here? [326010020] The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind. [326010030] I hope you understand the weight of my words. Section 11 [326011000] Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. [326011010] I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue. [326011020] Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder. [326011030] But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death. [326011040] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. Section 12 [326012000] This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death. [326012010] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. Section 13 [326013000] So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt. [326013010] Then I shall introduce myself once more. [326013020] Bernahl, a recusant, just like you. [326013030] Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter. [326013040] Why not add some to your repertoire? Section 14 [326014000] Oh, not had your fill, eh? Section 15 [326015000] You're still alive, I see. [326015010] Why not learn another battle art, see if we can't keep it that way. Section 16 [326016000] You've come to understand, now, eh? [326016010] To take power and make it his own, [326016020] The recusant must hunt his own kind. [326016030] To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging, [326016040] We recusants must become the most wretched of predators. [326016050] All you can do is laugh. Section 17 [326017000] Look at you. A recusant through and through. [326017010] I knew you had it in you. [326017020] Take this. [326017030] A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold. [326017040] If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle. Section 18 [326018000] Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return. [326018010] I have the reward from Lady Tanith. [326018020] Take it. It's yours, by right. [326018030] Let us tread the path of the recusant together. [326018040] Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us. Section 20 [326020000] So. You killed Rykard? [326020010] I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code. [326020020] Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh. [326020030] But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more. [326020040] Though we may yet fulfil an old promise. [326020050] We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs. [326020060] And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree. Section 21 [326021000] O Greater Will, hear my voice. [326021010] I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade. [326021020] We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning. Section 30 [326030000] Who are you? [326030010] And what in heaven's name are you doing here? [326030020] The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind. [326030030] I hope you understand the weight of my words. Section 40 [326040000] Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. [326040010] You have harboured doubts from the very beginning. [326040020] Perhaps this day was always lurking on the horizon. [326040030] But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death. [326040040] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. Section 41 [326041000] Then you must leave immediately. [326041010] Those with weak stomachs have no place here. Section 42 [326042000] I thought I told you to leave. [326042010] Or do you claim to understand? [326042020] What it means to be a recusant, renouncing grace and hunting down one's own. Section 43 [326043000] Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. [326043010] But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death. [326043020] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that. "

[330001030] My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs. [330001040] Do you know the origin of this place? [330001050] How it came to be known as the Church of Vows? Section 02 [330002000] Well, that is a shame. But who can blame you? [330002010] The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear. [330002020] It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. [330002030] By the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radagon and Rennala of the Full Moon. [330002040] And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses. [330002050] The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Section 03 [330003000] Oh, was there something you needed? [330003010] You are free to show yourself around. [330003020] I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be... [330003030] If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you. [330003040] Unless perhaps you are in search of instruction? [330003050] In which case, I will share all that I know. [330003060] Whether it be sorcery or incantations, learning should not fetter you to one side or the other. [330003070] This is, after all, a church celebrating the union of two such opposed practitioners. Section 04 [330004000] Is there something else? Section 10 [330010000] Greetings. Do you need anything? Section 11 [330011000] Do you possess any celestial dew? [330011010] Then I would like to share my knowledge with you. [330011020] Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows. [330011030] Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew, [330011040] repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala. [330011050] The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven. [330011060] This miracle blesses the church to this day. [330011070] And so, you need only follow Radagon's example, [330011080] to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony. Section 12 [330012000] My faith does not waver. [330012010] The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world. [330012020] And this time, its bounty will not be squandered. [330012030] If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished, [330012040] I hope that you, too, will share my faith. Section 14 [330014000] Are you taking the sword with you? [330014010] Oh, fear not, I don't wish to chide you. [330014020] Clearly, you are no conniving thief. [330014030] The sword is telling us something, no doubt. [330014040] Rather than collect dust in the shadows underground, [330014050] it yearns to be wielded by your rightful hand. [330014060] Ah, now I recall. [330014070] As the priest of the Church of Vows, I undo the sword's seal, and bequeath it unto you. [330014080] May you hold it high and proud. Section 20 [330020000] Are you quite finished? [330020010] Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions. [330020020] Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving. [330020030] Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain. [330020040] And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain. Section 21 [330021000] Are you quite finished? [330021010] I suppose my ample frame must have given you quite the fright. [330021020] Allow me to introduce myself. Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber. [330021030] My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs. [330021040] Do you know the origin of this place? [330021050] How it came to be known as the Church of Vows? Section 22 [330022000] Are you quite finished, now? Section 31 [330031000] To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew. [330031010] Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights. Section 33 [330033000] Ah, I see you have undergone absolution, the miracle that blossoms from these grounds. [330033010] Good. As such, the bond you may have strained or severed... [330033020] Has been restored, to its rightful state of harmony. [330033030] Be mindful, not to take for granted... [330033040] the serenity restored by this miracle. [330033050] And take care. Never to break a bond again. Section 50 [330050000] You wish to know more of Lord Radagon? [330050010] Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks. [330050020] He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle. [330050030] He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen. [330050040] However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between, [330050050] Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort. [330050060] Taking the title...of second Elden Lord. [330050070] The mystery endures, to this day... [330050080] As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside... [330050090] And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord... Section 51 [330051000] You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret... [330051010] A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature. [330051020] When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet. [330051030] And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too. Section 52 [330052000] You wish to know more of Lady Rennala? [330052010] She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [330052020] The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch. [330052030] Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her. [330052040] And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library. Section 53 [330053000] In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her. [330053010] Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite; [330053020] the grim art of reincarnation. [330053030] You would do well to remember... [330053040] Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire. Section 60 [330060000] Why, this is nectar, is it not? [330060010] And you're giving it to me? [330060020] Oh, wonderful, just wonderful. [330060030] Truth be told, I'm rather fond of the stuff. [330060040] I'll happily take it off your hands! Section 61 [330061000] sleeping "

[333006020] Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [333006030] For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge. Section 20 [333020000] Apologies, friend. [333020010] I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity. [333020020] Oh, right. [333020030] I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit. [333020040] You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water? [333020050] That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries. [333020060] Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now. [333020070] After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering, [333020080] the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here. [333020100] As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, [333020110] making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key. [333020120] And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key. [333020130] When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning. Section 21 [333021000] Why not find yourself a glintstone key? [333021010] Without one, you can't pass through the academy, [333021020] and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital. [333021030] And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps... [333021040] Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient - [333021050] would you consider donating it to me? [333021060] I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery. [333021070] But still, my place is at the academy... Section 22 [333022000] Oh, one more thing... Beware the Albinaurics... [333022010] ...accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City. [333022020] The curse withered the legs of the old, and silenced the tongues of the Frogs. [333022030] And now they hold deep grudges for anyone left untouched. Section 23 [333023000] Thank you, kind soul. [333023010] For learning my paltry sorceries. [333023020] I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher. Section 24 [333024000] Are you certain? [333024010] You're willing to give your glintstone key to me? [333024020] \u2026My oh my! [333024030] Thank you, thank you dearly. [333024040] Now I can go back to the academy. [333024050] To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars. [333024060] ... Section 25 [333025000] You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen? [333025010] Well, that is something. [333025020] Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy. [333025030] I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us. [333025040] But Sellen was expelled from the academy. [333025050] Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch. [333025060] I still don't believe the accusations. [333025070] The illustrious Sellen would never do such things... Section 26 [333026000] Find yourself a glintstone key. [333026010] Without one, you can't pass through the academy, [333026020] and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital. Section 30 [333030000] Well, what's this? [333030010] For me, is it? But surely, that's a passing fine brew? [333030020] My meagre sorceries hardly warrant such a reward. [333030030] Oh, bless you. [333030040] I'll save it for a special occasion. [333030050] I may never have another drink like it for as long as I live. Section 31 [333031000] ... Section 40 [333040000] So, you've found yourself a glintstone key. [333040010] But I certainly can't take it from you. [333040020] That key belongs to you. [333040030] By rights, you should use it for yourself. [333040040] It's true, I wish to return to my place of study. [333040050] But that's no excuse to impose upon others. [333040060] Ah...is this why bluntstones always finish last? Section 41 [333041000] Head to the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [333041010] Carry on with your journey. Press forward with your fight. [333041020] Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake. Section 51 [333051000] Thank you dearly. [333051010] With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria. [333051020] Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit?

[334011010] I wonder if you've met my foster father? [334011020] He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there. [334011030] If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself. [334011040] Father is leader of the Roundtable. [334011050] I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while. Section 12 [334012000] It's about time I headed off.

What's happened to this village? [334030030] I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy. [334030040] The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked. [334030050] A waking nightmare, made by men. Section 31 [334031000] But this time, I'm a woman grown. [334031010] And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice. [334031020] Justice to the oppressors. [334031030] Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior. Section 40 [334040000] Ah, you... [334040010] Please, leave me be. [334040020] It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think. Section 41 [334041000] ...So you know already, do you? [334041010] Right. It's true. My father cast me out. [334041020] For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns. [334041030] Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life. [334041040] I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord. [334041050] And yet I... Though it was not my intent... [334041060] I betrayed him... Section 42 [334042000] I...can no longer trust in father... [334042010] To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy... [334042020] Where is the justice he purports, in that? [334042030] He once told me that if he became Elden Lord, [334042040] he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again. [334042050] Was he simply lying to me? Section 43 [334043000] No, no, no... [334043010] How could I say that? [334043020] Father has always given me his guidance... [334043030] And now...I've lost it... [334043040] ... Section 50 [334050000] Medicine, is it? [334050010] Fine. I'll take a dose. Perhaps it'll do me some good. [334050020] ... [334050030] It's very sweet...isn't it... [334050040] And very...very... [334050050] ... Section 60 [334060000] Is that ash? [334060010] I can smell the ancient storm in it... [334060030] My thanks. I'll gladly take it. Section 61 [334061000] I'm...not like Roderika. [334061010] I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them. [334061020] Still, this ash.. [334061030] It reminds me of my first hawk. [334061040] Thank you. Section 62 [334062000] In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm. [334062010] It reminds me of my first hawk. Section 70 [334070000] It's been some time. [334070010] I must thank you, for your aid. [334070020] I told father I would be with him no longer. [334070030] I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago. [334070040] This land is much like the one from which I hail. [334070050] I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds. Section 71 [334071000] Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior. [334071010] Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath. [334071020] Though I have now abandoned my former guidance. [334071030] I cannot express how much you've helped me. [334071040] Should you become Elden Lord. [334071050] I would gladly lighten your burden. Section 72 [334072000] Farewell, fellow warrior. [334072010] I will remain, to summon the storm. [334072020] But your guidance, and your fight... [334072030] Surely lie elsewhere. Section 73 [334073000] I will remain, to summon the storm. [334073010] But your guidance, and your fight... [334073020] Surely lie elsewhere. "

[335001030] Perhaps you've heard of dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals? [335001040] Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it. [335001050] And if you were to help me gather its ingredients, [335001060] I'd gladly share some with you. [335001070] The Lands Between are no kind place for we Tarnished. [335001080] And I'm getting too old to keep scavenging corpses on the battlefield... Section 02 [335002000] You'll help me then? [335002010] Wonderful! Music to my ears. [335002020] Then take this with you. [335002030] That, is St. Trina's Crystal Ball. [335002040] It can be used to take slumber fog from those submerged in deepest sleep, [335002050] those merry fools sunk so low they will not awaken. [335002060] Dreambrew, I should say, is a special filtration of slumber fog. Section 03 [335003000] Go ahead and bring me some slumber fog, my compeer. [335003010] About two should do it, by my reckoning... [335003020] About three should do it, by my reckoning... [335003030] About four should do it, by my reckoning... [335003040] About five should do it, by my reckoning... [335003050] About six should do it, by my reckoning... [335003060] And then I'll have enough dreambrew to share. [335003070] Drink is a wonderful teacher. Imbibe and you will understand; this world's delights, and its futility. Section 04 [335004000] You what? You hardly know what you're missing out on. [335004010] Well, suit yourself. But I'm sure you'll be after a drink before long. [335004020] Perhaps you'll tire of this crumbling world... [335004030] Or maybe you'll wish to uncover someone's deepest, darkest secrets... Section 05 [335005000] What? Taken an interest in the finer things, after all? [335005010] Like dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals? [335005020] Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it. [335005030] And if you were to help me gather its ingredients, [335005040] I'd gladly share some with you. [335005050] What do you say? Section 10 [335010000] Ah, I've been eagerly awaiting your return. [335010010] How did you fare? Find any slumber fog? Section 11 [335011000] Hmm, not quite enough. [335011010] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need two doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. [335011020] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need three doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. [335011030] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need four doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. [335011040] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need five doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. [335011050] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need six doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts. Section 12 [335012000] I see, I see. You have what I asked. [335012010] All splendid fogs of superior quality. Sediment firmly settled, mm. [335012020] Good work, my compeer. [335012030] Here's the dreambrew I promised. All yours. Section 13 [335013000] Bring me more slumber fog, my compeer. [335013010] Do so, and I'll have a bottle of dreambrew with your name on it. Section 14 [335014000] Allow me a little advice, my compeer. [335014010] Dreambrew is known to drag people's secrets into the daylight. [335014020] If that's what you seek, rather than the usual fleeting pleasures, [335014030] Then treat them to some dreambrew. [335014040] Secrets are like fine wine. The longer they mature in the dark, the richer the flavour... [335014050] Know that, and all will be as you desire. Friendship, rule, intrigue... Section 15 [335015000] Did you forget something? Section 16 [335016000] Oh, hello there. [335016010] Have you brought me some more slumber fog? Section 17 [335017000] You certainly have a taste for spirits. [335017010] I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you. Section 18 [335018000] ... Section 19 [335019000] ... [335019010] ... Section 20 [335020000] As you surely know, my compeer, I am but a humble man of the cloth. [335020010] And I must profess, the study of alcohol is but another form of worship. [335020020] Oh, St. Trina. My faith is in alcohol, and the hearts of men. Section 30 [335030000] Ah, good to see you. [335030010] I heard the path to the Haligtree had been reopened. [335030020] So I forced these old bones to weather the journey. [335030030] Don't tell me it was you who opened the passage? [335030040] Nevertheless, it's rather nippy in these lands, eh. [335030050] But there's nothing like a good drink to warm the cockles... Section 31 [335031000] Did you need something else? Section 32 [335032000] Oh it's, good, good to see you. [335032010] I think I was about to freeze solid. Section 33 [335033000] ... Section 34 [335034000] ... [335034010] ... Section 40 [335040000] You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands. [335040010] Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery. [335040020] The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers. [335040030] Hm? That's quite a face you're pulling... [335040040] Need I remind you? Though I am but a humble man of the cloth, [335040050] each of us has our secrets, my compeer. Section 41 [335041000] You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands. [335041010] Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery. [335041020] The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers. Section 50 [335050000] Finally, I have found it! [335050010] St. Trina's, no, Lord Miquella's cadaver. [335050020] I have partaken of untold secrets. [335050030] Such that I might aid you, O Lord. [335050040] So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico, [335050050] Into your dream, the world of your heart. [335050060] Indeed, I beg you grant my wish, [335050070] That when you transcend from empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side. Section 51 [335051000] I have partaken of untold secrets. [335051010] Such that I might aid you, O Lord. [335051020] So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico, [335051030] Into your dream, the world of your heart.

[337001010] After being out there, it must be quite surprising, [337001020] to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace. [337001030] The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal. Section 02 [337002000] Oh? [337002010] I didn't notice that you were Tarnished. [337002020] ... [337002030] Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way. [337002040] But you must leave the capital at once. Section 03 [337003000] It is for your own good, I assure you. [337003010] All things have their proper place. [337003020] We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital. [337003030] You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here. [337003040] So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch. [337003050] The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds. [337003060] Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground. [337003070] But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken! [337003080] Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace, [337003090] the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall! [337003100] The lesson here is self-evident. [337003110] The capital is simply not where you belong. Section 04 [337004000] You mustn't take it the wrong way. [337004010] But you must leave the capital at once. Section 10 [337010000] Well, what have we here... [337010010] You hunt Omen, do you? [337010020] Mm-hmm, yes it appears so... [337010030] Well, then perhaps we can talk. [337010040] For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly. [337010050] Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being. [337010060] And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen. [337010070] The Undercapital is a repository of waste. [337010080] For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn. [337010090] And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here. [337010100] A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity. Section 11 [337011000] Get on with it, then. [337011010] Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls. [337011020] I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight. Section 20 [337020000] Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet? [337020010] Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw. [337020020] I forgive you. [337020030] We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble. Section 21 [337021000] Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet? [337021010] That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad. Section 30 [337030000] Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you. [337030010] You must've expunged the Omen from the repository. [337030020] Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears. [337030030] Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say. [337030040] The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it. [337030050] No, this is above their station... [337030060] If I explained that this was all my idea, [337030070] I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace. [337030080] What a wondrous opportunity. [337030090] That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace. [337030100] Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights. Section 31 [337031000] Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely. [337031010] This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations. [337031020] It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request. Section 32 [337032000] I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but... [337032010] For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory. Section 33 [337033000] Now, I need to get myself ready. [337033010] If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace, [337033020] I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best. Section 40 [337040000] Kill our lord... [337040010] He is a stain upon all things golden... [337040020] Kill Morgott, kingly impostor! [337040030] "

[348002020] My flesh writhes with scarlet rot. [348002030] It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man. Section 03 [348003000] If you are wise, you will leave, immediately. [348003010] My flesh writhes with scarlet rot. Section 10 [348010000] You ask that I stab myself with the needle... [348010010] To quell the scarlet rot? [348010020] But...how? [348010030] ...

[348020020] Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe. [348020030] Even the nightmares have abated... And now, though I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please. [348020040] Not that I could ever truly repay you, [348020050] but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is. Section 21 [348021000] I'm considering leaving. On a journey. [348021010] With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly... [348021020] My destiny... [348021030] It's all thanks to you. [348021040] My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again. Section 22 [348022000] I'm considering leaving. On a journey. [348022010] With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly... [348022020] My destiny... Section 25 [348025000] Oh, hello again. [348025010] Something about this place felt familiar to me. [348025020] So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here. [348025030] But I've only found emptiness. [348025040] Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to. Section 26 [348026000] Well, never mind that. [348026010] I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank. [348026020] I must stay strong. Section 30 [348030000] Ah. We meet again. [348030010] In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me. [348030020] The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met. [348030030] As such, I've been able to continue my journey. [348030040] Though rather vexingly, [348030050] I realise that if I still had my sword arm, [348030060] I could have aided you in battle. Section 31 [348031000] Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, [348031010] after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds. [348031020] I should like to meet her, this vanished woman. [348031030] I think she's in the north. [348031040] In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree. Section 32 [348032000] Are you... [348032010] Giving me this arm? [348032020] I thank you. [348032030] I am in your debt, yet again. [348032040] I think, If the arm serves well enough, [348032050] It might be possible for me to wield a sword again. Section 33 [348033000] If the arm serves well enough, [348033010] It might be possible for me to wield a sword again. [348033020] Perhaps, then, I can aid you in battle. Section 35 [348035000] Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took. [348035010] She's passed into to the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree. Section 40 [348040000] Ah, we meet yet again. [348040010] The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. [348040020] It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. [348040030] Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. [348040040] Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle again, should you ever have the need. Section 41 [348041000] Ah, we meet yet again. [348041010] The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. [348041020] It feels just like my own, even handling a sword. [348041030] Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword. [348041040] Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need. Section 42 [348042000] I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need. [348042010] It is the only way that I can express my thanks. Section 50 [348050000] To think we'd meet in such a place... [348050010] What could your purpose possibly... [348050020] No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me. [348050030] Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need. Section 51 [348051000] I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins. [348051010] I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. [348051020] I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. [348051030] Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. [348051040] The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands. Section 52 [348052000] I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins. [348052010] I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. [348052020] I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree. Section 60 [348060000] Again we meet. [348060010] I can only surmise our purposes are aligned. [348060020] In which case, allow me to explain myself. [348060030] I am of Malenia's blood. [348060040] But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot\u2026 [348060050] Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us. Section 61 [348061000] There is something I must return to Malenia. [348061010] The will that was once her own. [348061020] The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. [348061030] The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure. Section 62 [348062000] There is something I must return to Malenia. [348062010] The will that was once her own. [348062020] The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. Section 70 [348070000] Oh, hello. [348070010] Thank you for lending your hand. [348070020] Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet. [348070030] I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end. [348070040] Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing. Section 71 [348071000] But this is where things end. [348071010] I pause to even tell you, but... [348071020] I took out the needle myself. [348071030] Tell whoever put you up to this. [348071040] That if I am to flower into something other than myself, [348071050] I would rather rot into nothingness as I am. Section 72 [348072000] Please, let me pass alone. [348072010] The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever. [348072020] Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh. [348072030] Curse-laden. Untouchable. [348072040] I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm. "

[349001020] I'd hoped to ask a favour, when one of your ilk came along. [349001030] A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia. [349001040] Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense. [349001050] Should you accept\u2026 [349001060] I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there. Section 10 [349010000] Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you? [349010010] I need your help to heal a certain young girl. [349010020] Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia, [349010030] resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness. Section 11 [349011000] The rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure. [349011010] When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood. [349011020] But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated. [349011030] For this, you are to find a certain needle. [349011040] Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds. [349011050] The needle, made from unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there. Section 12 [349012000] First, you must find the unalloyed gold needle. [349012010] It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia. [349012020] Then I will tell you, as promised. [349012030] The secret of the town of Sellia. Section 13 [349013000] Ah, my apologies. I rather got ahead of myself, didn't I. [349013010] Well, no matter. I'm accustomed to waiting. [349013020] But if you should decide to hear my offer, whenever that may be, [349013030] do come and speak with me again. [349013040] I'll wait as long as it takes. Section 14 [349014000] Ah, changed your mind, have you? [349014010] If you are willing to undertake my request, [349014020] I'll gladly share with you the secret of Sellia, the town yonder. Section 20 [349020000] Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle. [349020010] As promised, I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here. [349020020] Go on, it's yours. [349020030] Now, let me have a look at the needle. [349020040] Hmm. [349020050] Hmmmm. [349020060] Well, well, this is a marvel indeed. [349020070] The work of a true artisan\u2026a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life. [349020080] Can you give me some time with this? [349020090] As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it. Section 21 [349021000] I have awaited your return. [349021010] The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure. [349021020] Will you give it to the girl, Millicent? [349021030] I will reward you in kind. [349021040] Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder. [349021050] Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god. [349021060] A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this. Section 22 [349022000] Do you find it peculiar? [349022010] That I would show such concern for the girl. [349022020] Well, I'm the one that found her. [349022030] A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia. [349022040] She is one of my dear daughters. [349022050] But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory. [349022060] I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me. [349022070] Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much. [349022080] Ha ha ha... Section 23 [349023000] Can you give me some time with this? [349023010] As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it. Section 27 [349027000] Now, all you need do is deliver the needle to Millicent. [349027010] She's convalescing in the church atop the cliff just beyond Sellia. [349027020] Do so, and you shall receive handsome recompense, of course. Section 30 [349030000] Thank you kindly. [349030010] For giving the needle to Millicent. [349030020] Now she, too, can begin her journey. [349030030] And stare her fate straight in the eye. [349030040] You've been a saint, through and through. [349030050] As thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge [349030060] of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, descendants of the Eternal. Section 31 [349031000] Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed. [349031010] Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior, [349031020] but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young. Section 32 [349032000] Oh, you noticed, did you? [349032010] Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home. [349032020] It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly. [349032030] However, she has no need of me, any more. [349032040] No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede. [349032050] As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young... [349032060] Is to be forgotten. Section 35 [349035000] Ah, welcome, welcome. How may I help? Section 36 [349036000] Do you...need me for something else? Section 40 [349040000] So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement\u2026 [349040010] This is a wonderful development. [349040020] Thank you for your kindness. [349040030] Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential. [349040040] Like her beautiful mother. Section 41 [349041000] The girl, Millicent. She is a bud. [349041010] Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence. [349041020] What a wondrous day that will be. [349041030] In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. [349041040] She might very well outshine her sisters. Section 50 [349050000] Do you have an interest in rot incantations? [349050010] Then you might like to learn something of the history... [349050020] of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot. Section 51 [349051000] Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them. [349051010] She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot. [349051020] An Empyrean...is no mere demigod. [349051030] In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika, [349051040] the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order. [349051050] Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her. [349051060] And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth. Section 60 [349060000] Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she? [349060010] The words of a true innocent, the dear girl. [349060020] Well, perhaps this is just as it should be. [349060030] Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what. [349060040] This is their fate, after all. Section 70 [349070000] sobbing Section 71 [349071000] Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there. [349071010] Welcome. How may I help you? [349071020] My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that. Section 72 [349072000] Oh, it's just\u2026 [349072010] I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and\u2026 [349072020] My eyes began to well... [349072030] She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters. [349072040] And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower. [349072050] Which is why... [349072060] If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters, [349072070] I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent. [349072080] It must be done by your hand; no other. [349072090] Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact. [349072100] Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly. [349072110] When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn. [349072120] As a scarlet valkyrie. Section 73 [349073000] Thus, I have a request of the utmost import. [349073010] I beg you, kill Millicent. [349073020] Before the girl can meet her sisters. [349073030] There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone. [349073040] You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart. [349073050] Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you. [349073060] Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie. Section 74 [349074000] You can't tell me you don't wish to see it. [349074010] The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers? [349074020] I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands. Section 75 [349075000] Welcome, welcome. How may I help you? [349075010] Oh how I have counted the days. Millicent shall soon meet her sisters. Section 76 [349076000] When the time is ripe... [349076010] Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies. [349076020] sigh [349076030] Millicent, my daughter. [349076040] Why would you take out the needle? [349076050] You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers. [349076060] Would you disown us too? As your Mother did? [349076070] We children of the scarlet rot? Section 78 [349078000] Millicent... [349078010] Malenia... [349078020] Do you detest us, so utterly? Section 80 [349080000] Have you taken the lesson, now? [349080010] Killing me is but an exercise in futility. [349080020] All is well, provided you understand. [349080030] Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we? [349080040] sobbing [349080050] O Millicent, my daughter... [349080060] Who would prune your sapling flesh? [349080070] Such...such cruel and vulgar violence... [349080080] sobbing "

[351001040] So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them, [351001050] ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men. [351001060] By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace. Section 02 [351002000] You do! Wonderful news. [351002010] Most Tarnished are blind to it these days. [351002020] You are something of a rare breed. [351002030] Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers? Section 03 [351003000] Ah, well, that is unfortunate. [351003010] But no cause for despair. [351003020] It's likely a temporary condition, I'm told. For whatever reason, it happens from time to time. [351003030] Just keep your chin up, and stay the path. [351003040] I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you. Section 04 [351004000] What is it? [351004010] Has the guidance of grace returned to your vision? Section 05 [351005000] Ah, I see. [351005010] Just keep your chin up, and stay the path. [351005020] I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you. Section 10 [351010000] Further study of incantations, is it? [351010010] I can happily spare the time, and applaud your enthusiasm. Section 11 [351011000] Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good. [351011010] Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation? Section 12 [351012000] May the Golden Order shine through you. Section 15 [351015000] There's something I should mention to you, as well. [351015010] I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold. [351015020] Do you know of the noble Goldmask? [351015030] Though he was but a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between, [351015040] he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace. [351015050] And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order... [351015060] I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research. Section 20 [351020000] Ah, I had been waiting for your return. [351020010] I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all. [351020020] As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask. [351020030] We may not meet again for some time. [351020040] If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment. Section 21 [351021000] Ah, I had been waiting for your return. [351021010] I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold. [351021020] I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the Goldmask, to beg his instruction. [351021030] We may not meet again for some time. [351021040] If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment. Section 30 [351030000] Ah, look who we have here. [351030010] How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold. [351030020] I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually. [351030030] And will happily pass it along to you. Section 35 [351035000] I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask. [351035010] I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree. [351035020] The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall. [351035030] Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude, [351035040] How little it is I truly know... Section 36 [351036000] Do...do you sport with me!? [351036010] From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself! [351036020] Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by. [351036030] Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays. [351036040] And to you too. My sincerest thanks. Section 37 [351037000] I will soon leave to join the noble Goldmask. [351037010] It is entirely thanks to you. You have my sincerest gratitude. Section 40 [351040000] Ah, we meet yet again. [351040010] Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself, [351040020] and taken my place by his side, as you can see. [351040030] Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before. [351040040] Though we must do so quietly, such that we not disturb the great master's cogitation. Section 41 [351041000] Further study of incantations, is it? [351041010] Indeed, I applaud your enthusiasm. Section 42 [351042000] Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good. [351042010] Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation? Section 43 [351043000] May the Golden Order shine through you. Section 45 [351045000] The master is always deep in contemplation. [351045010] While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger. [351045020] And though I am yet to comprehend even the daintiest morsel of his wisdom... [351045030] I know that this, this is my life's calling. [351045040] The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian. Section 46 [351046000] Master! What ever is the matter? [351046010] Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms! [351046020] I must be the one to record them! [351046030] What matters this issue of Radagon, really? [351046040] The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes! [351046050] Why must these qualms come to you now? [351046060] We were on the very cusp! Section 47 [351047000] Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed. [351047010] I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements. Section 48 [351048000] Did you need something else? Section 49 [351049000] Oh, was that you? [351049010] Yes, the master is still ceased. [351049020] And after coming all this way... Why now, of all times? Section 50 [351050000] The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree. [351050010] While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild. [351050020] Until he simply ceased. [351050030] Now the master is facing quite the puzzle. [351050040] The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However... [351050050] The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared... [351050060] Who exactly was Radagon? [351050070] The master is stumped. [351050080] His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered. [351050090] Curse my mediocre mind. [351050100] The master only has me, and here I fail him... Section 51 [351051000] What on earth did you do to the master? [351051010] Well, not that I'm complaining. [351051020] Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me. [351051030] I haven't the words to thank you. [351051040] So I'd like to pass this on to you instead. [351051050] A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly. Section 52 [351052000] To think, that Radagon was Marika herself. [351052010] Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger. [351052020] How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder. [351052030] Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself. [351052040] Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter? [351052050] ... [351052060] Well, either way, I can continue my documentation. [351052070] In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not, [351052080] I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose. Section 53 [351053000] Who exactly was Radagon? [351053010] The master is stumped. [351053020] His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered. [351053030] But oh, how important could it really be? [351053040] The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes! [351053050] Why must these qualms come to you now? [351053060] We were on the very cusp! Section 60 [351060000] Ah, nice to see you. [351060010] I can't believe you've come all this way. Section 61 [351061000] Do you need...something else? Section 62 [351062000] Ah, nice to see you. [351062010] Do you need...something else? Section 65 [351065000] I've\u2026been gripped by a terrifying thought. [351065010] The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger... [351065020] betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order. [351065030] A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked. [351065040] Oh, but how could this be? [351065050] I dread to even entertain the possibility... [351065060] but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master. [351065070] Tell me, have I simply lost my head? [351065080] Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order, [351065090] why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire? Section 66 [351066000] Oh master, put my mind at ease. [351066010] Dispel these fearsome thoughts. [351066020] I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe. [351066030] sobbing Section 67 [351067000] What...is this? [351067010] It will make me forget, you say? [351067020] So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts... [351067030] Ha...ha ha... [351067040] Would that I could... Would that I could... [351067050] Section 70 [351070000] Oh, it's you. [351070010] I've finally come to understand. [351070020] The master was nothing more than a madman. [351070030] Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order, [351070040] seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own! [351070050] Could there be a more pitiable comedy? [351070060] Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes! [351070070] Ha...ha ha ha... Section 80 [351080000] Master...where did you go? [351080010] I'm right here. Please, show me. [351080020] Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus. [351080030] Let me document the motions... [351080040] Master...master... [351080050] Where did you go? Section 90 [351090000] This...is a volume of incantation. [351090010] It's good to see your enthusiasm. [351090020] Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands. Section 91 [351091000] That...is a work of heresy. [351091010] Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree. [351091020] My interests lie solely in the Golden Order. [351091030] I cannot accept this. Section 92 [351092000] That...is a work of heresy. [351092010] Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree. [351092020] ... [351092030] Very well...I'll take it off your hands. [351092040] I cannot afford to maintain my innocence any longer. I must dirty my hands to test my faith. [351092050] Even if it offers only the most meagre of hints, I will do whatever I can to help my master. "

[800001030] Then why not purchase a little something? [800001040] I am Kal\u00e9. Purveyor of fine goods. Section 02 [800002000] What is it? Still going to purchase something? Section 03 [800003000] Wait, weren't you...? [800003010] Well, you're back. Care to buy something? Section 04 [800004000] Ah, it's you again. [800004010] Always a pleasure. Care to purchase anything? Section 05 [800005000] Good-bye for now. Section 06 [800006000] Good-bye. Nice to do business. Section 07 [800007000] I am of a nomadic people. [800007010] Selling wares as I travel. [800007020] The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. [800007030] It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely. [800007040] Let's say you're a very welcome customer. Section 08 [800008000] You know, if you can spare the runes, [800008010] you should buy yourself a crafting kit. [800008020] A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. [800008030] Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration. [800008040] The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut. [800008050] But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all. Section 09 [800009000] I'm glad you took my warning to heart. [800009010] You've made an excellent choice. Section 10 [800010000] There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands. [800010010] If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you? [800010020] My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold. [800010030] Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey. [800010040] But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered. [800010050] I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts. [800010060] Your people, the Tarnished, and mine. Section 11 [800011000] I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you. [800011010] I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time. [800011020] My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason... [800011030] But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan. Section 12 [800012000] Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but... [800012010] See that no harm comes to my kin. [800012020] We have a saying, we wanderers. [800012030] Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing. [800012040] But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy. [800012050] That is our code, so to speak. [800012060] Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving. Section 13 [800013000] Ah, by the way... [800013010] Have you heard of the Great Caravan? Section 14 [800014000] ...I see, more's the pity. [800014010] Well, even we had a place to call home, once. [800014020] The Great Caravan, they called it\u2026 but it's been lost to us for ages. [800014030] I've been searching for it as long as I can remember. [800014040] And with a name like that, [800014050] You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh. Section 15 [800015000] The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood... [800015010] I suppose he must still be skulking about... [800015020] Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself? [800015030] Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source. [800015040] Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear. [800015050] I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off. Section 16 [800016000] Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet. [800016010] If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source. Section 17 [800017000] Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you? [800017010] Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction. [800017020] He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg. [800017030] I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another. Section 30 [800030000] Ah, good to see you. [800030010] I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble. [800030020] Thought I'd set up shop here for a time. [800030030] A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything? Section 31 [800031000] We meet again, I see. [800031010] It's me, Kal\u00e9. [800031020] Thought I'd set up shop here for a time. [800031030] Right then. Care to purchase anything? Section 32 [800032000] Have you seen a crow around here by any chance? [800032010] You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw? [800032020] Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question. [800032030] I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course. Section 33 [800033000] My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this. [800033010] And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised. Section 34 [800034000] So, about the letter you brought me... [800034010] It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people. [800034020] And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to. [800034030] This could be my chance to get close to it. [800034040] Thanks to you. Section 35 [800035000] Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again. [800035010] Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone. [800035020] With any luck, I'll see you there, eh. Section 36 [800036000] I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's... [800036010] And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors... [800036020] But there's something I need to know. [800036030] My roots. [800036040] I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed. Section 50 [800050000] Ah, good to see you. [800050010] I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble. [800050020] The shop is all set up. [800050030] A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything? Section 51 [800051000] Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter... [800051010] I think it's pointing underneath the capital. [800051020] I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital. [800051030] But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there. [800051040] Well, the journey can wait, I suppose. [800051050] I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it. Section 52 [800052000] Where...did you find this letter? Section 53 [800053000] I can't imagine how it ended up there... [800053010] But the well might just lead under the capital. [800053020] To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter. [800053030] Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan... [800053040] But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation. [800053050] Once again, I find myself in your debt. [800053060] Take this, as a token of my appreciation. [800053070] It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special. [800053080] I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact. [800053090] Who knows what wonders there might be to trade? Section 54 [800054000] Ah, you, is it... [800054010] Did you see? What they did to my ancestors? [800054020] The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves. [800054030] Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore. [800054040] They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them? [800054050] Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us!  [800054060] The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks. [800054070] But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims... [800054080] I'll never forgive any of you. Section 55 [800055000] I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer. [800055010] And...I think it's time we parted ways. [800055020] Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord. [800055030] I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more. Section 56 [800056000] I should apologise to you. [800056010] It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess. [800056020] I'm sorry. Section 57 [800057000] I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer. [800057010] I think it's time we parted ways. Section 58 [800058000] Wait, what's that? [800058010] That burn... [800058020] Your eyes... [800058030] You've inherited the flame of frenzy! [800058040] Oh, that's it... That's what I need... [800058050] To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. [800058060] The yellow flame of chaos... Section 59 [800059000] Oh, that's it... That's what I need... [800059010] To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. [800059020] The yellow flame of chaos... Section 70 [800070000] O Three Fingers, throw wide the door.

[800070030] May chaos take the world. [800070040] May chaos take the world. Section 71 [800071000] The frenzied flame...burned me... [800071010] I was not... a suitable home. [800071020] Unknown warrior... [800071030] You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss... [800071040] Tell the one... Who will become Lord...

[800071080] To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. [800071090] May chaos...take the world. [800071100] ... Section 72 [800072000] The frenzied flame...burned me...
